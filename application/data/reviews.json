But after the stay, we were more than impressed. A couple of highlights about the Vdara: its not even a block off the strip (between the Aria and the Cosmo), its Eco-friendly, smoke-free, dog friendly, casino-free, and simple. It was perfect retreat after spending the day on the strip. We had a little kitchenette, a beautiful view, a simple pool, and it was quiet. It was definitely and attraction and the lobby was always bustling, but it wasn't anything in comparison to the other hotels. Its not clique and we really enjoyed ourselves. They were always accommodating and the Spa is drop-dead gorgeous. If it want a life off the strip (but not compromise location), the Vadara is the place to be."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Justin", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-10-3", "review": "Having been to Vegas more times than I can count, I have stayed in almost every resort on and off the Strip. Recently, I received a great offer from Vdara and my girlfriend and I stayed there while going to a concert at the Cosmo, which is next door. And I can honestly say, Vdara shot up my list as one of my favorite hotels. \n\nFirst off, the normal suite was very comfortable. The bed was top notch, as were the pillows. The furniture was very comfortable and the decor was also very impressive. I also love that the hotel prides itself on being energy efficient but it does not forget to be elegant. By that I mean all the modern appliances, like electric window curtains. I was also very impressed with the bathroom, shower and everything else. The electronic keypad is a little odd and I could see how someone who is stumbling back after a fun night may have a little problem with that but alas, that is not the resorts fault. \n\nNow the other reason for the 5-star review, the concierge was incredible. My girlfriend and I are extremely lactose intolerant but we also want to enjoy food in Vegas. We called down to the concierge and asked for her recommendation for a healthy buffet, kind of an oxymoron I know. However, the concierge called several other MGM Resort buffets and recommended either Aria or the Bellagio. Having eaten at the Bellagio, I was pretty sure that would work but the chef at Aria was willing to give us a personal tour of the each food item and if something had dairy, he would be willing to make it without dairy. We decided on there but before we left, the concierge sent us front of the line passes.  \n\nI truly wish I remember the woman's name but we were so impressed that obviously she received a nice tip but also we spoke to her manager and told her just how amazing she was. \n\nNow I gamble, love it actually but I also like staying in a hotel without a casino. I believe that it allows me to have a better nice sleep, I will not stumble into a casino and just try my luck really quick and it was also keeps the drunks and smoke out of the hotel as well. But it is also really close to the tables, this case the Cosmo and Aria. \n\nMy girlfriend and I also love to work out and thought the gym was very impressive. It had a large selection of cardio machines and free weights. It is a tad small but I expect not many people use it. We did not have enough time to visit the pool, even though it looked a little small nor the spa, which was expensive but looked wonderful. \n\nOverall, if you want a 5-star experience and wonderful customer service, I would highly recommend Vdara. On my many trips back to Vegas, I will always look there first."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "M", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-10-3", "review": "Love the executive room!

Yet, 50 plus times I have been awoken in the middle of the night by a drunk, inconsiderate group coming back to their room at 3:00 a.m. But not this time.

There is only one place to plug in your things and it's not very convenient. There are no plugs close to the bed. The fridge didn't keep our food cold so we weren't able to eat our leftovers. The tub was the only good part about the room. I will say that the spa is awesome. I really enjoyed it and the staff was great. On the other hand I left a dress there, called the same day to have them find it, and never received a call back.

Booked a room at Treasure Island but really wanted to be in the middle of the strip. Checked out Vdara and the views of the suites are impressive. Loved all the windows and it doesnt make you feel like you're a prisoner by walls and a small window like other hotels.\n\nBooked the City corner suite but got upgrade to the Executive suite and got the VIP treatment. My host Teresa comp me $100 to charge to my room and was very courteous showing me to my suite. The king size bed was so comfortable and relaxing. Flat screen in master room and living room. Stand in shower, double sink and deep bath tub is very nice. It had a nice kitchen with a electric stove, full size fridge with freezer, coffee maker. Living room had a queen pull out bed, and it also had a half bathroom. Very spacious and modern look.\n\nWhen trying to look for the valet it was a little bit confusing and it reminded me of LAX airport. The valet was is the best then any other hotel I been. There is no Casino here but have it at the main hotel at the Aria and is a few minutes to Bellagio hotel which you can take a little bridge and you are inside the hotel of Bellagio. Room service was quick and was set up in our dining room. There is a starbucks located in the lobby.\n\nVdara should put a sign or mention it to the guest that you have to show your keycard to the attendant standing next to the elevators. Stopping people going to to their room while there hands are full and stopping to look for the keycard can be a hassle. \n\n I would recommend the Hotel to family and friends. By the way I had family spread out the strip and some at old town and were jealous of the views and the suite.

Turns out that some of the beds have no floor board (not sure if that is the correct terminology) and the beds feels mushy and have no support. \n\nI don't usually experience back issues after sleeping but this bed made me so sore I woke up and took ibuprofen to deal with the pain. \n\nAfter complaining to the front desk and house keeping department and almost booking a flight back to Burbank... (A bad night sleep made me not want to be there any more because I was having day nightmares of the upcoming night) The bed did not get replaced... Then my boyfriend complained and followed up with everyone and eventually the housekeeping department installed the floor board and we had a slightly better nights sleep. \n\nShould it really take 4 complaints and half a day of waiting to make one's bed sleep worthy? My boyfriend and I are not your typical bad back people and I have never in my life complained about a hotel bed up until now. \n\nTo make matters worse our room was being cleaned around 7pm when my boyfriend got back from his fashion convention and he needed to shower and change. The house keeping department had hours to clean it and it never happened. Needless to say we both were floored with the level of service at what appeared to be a nice hotel on the surface. \n\nBecause of all the tragedies occurring I called Cosmo and was so close to switching our rooms and moving hotels. Since this was a company trip and we were not planning on paying for a hotel elsewhere we stayed put. Also I had all of my toiletries and suitcase completely unpacked so it was not easy to just get up and go. \n\nMoral of the story is Vdara should put those floor boards on every one of their beds and no one should be waiting hours to make their bed suitable for sleeping. Vdara take note please. If someone wants a mushy bed and back pain then they can call you to have it removed. \n\nOverall this is a very quiet hotel, do not come here if you want your hotel itself to be lively & fun. The Vdara pool area closed so early that we had to go to the Aria pool. I am assuming Vdara closes early to save money... We went to other pools and they were popping with people and music while our hotel's pool looked like a ghost town. \n\nOther issues with our company rooms- \nMy boyfriends one brother said he had no shower pressure in his shower. The other brother said they got a handicap room- he said the tub was built differently.\n\nAnd to top it off when we came back at midnight their was dirty laundry in the corner of our hall next to several doors within a few feet of our bed.

This seemed odd for a penthouse booking as we expected to be given a priority in check-in at the very least and we have seen other reviewers who had the two-bedroom Penthouse and they were offered priority check in, upgraded rooms with views of Bellagio lake, etc. We were offered none of that even though we had requested it months in advance. When we finally got up to the desk to pre-register we were told that the room was not ready, but that we could go ahead and check in and they would call us as soon as the room was ready which they expected to be within about two hours.\nSo we went to find a place for lunch. By the time we finished lunch it was about 2:00 and we had expected to hear something by then, but we did not, so we called to see if the room was ready. We could not get an answer as to whether or not the room was ready and all that they could tell us is that someone from housekeeping would be tracked down and we would receive a call back as soon as they could get a status. Over 30 minutes passed, so now it was 2:30, and we still had not gotten even a call back to update us as to the status of the room. We called twice between 2:30 and 3:00 from the lobby and were told the same thing, that no one from housekeeping could be reached and that the room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby watching other people check in, go to their rooms and come back down and leave, all the while we sat waiting with no answers and no one trying to resolve the problem. No remedies were offered at all...we were just left in limbo sitting in the lobby.\nFinally, at 3:15 out of desperation we got back in the check-in line, waited for another 15 minutes in line, and then when we finally got up to the desk and stated that we had been waiting and that it was now past check-in time, the lady got on the phone trying to get someone from housekeeping to get a status. She told us no one was answering and then she left the counter and said she'd be right back. We have no idea where she went, but she was gone for a long period of time, and finally at somewhere between 3:30 and 3:45 while we were still standing at the counter waiting for her to come back and tell us what was happening, our phone rang and it was housekeeping saying that the room was finally ready, at which point the lady at the desk reappeared. All this time nothing was offered to us, like some complimentary coffee at Starbucks, a couple of drinks in the Vdara bar while we waited, Nothing! This was a completely unacceptable course of events.\nThe people working the front desk have a very snobbish attitude and really don't seem to care about guests. Most of them don't appear to be experienced enough to work in a luxury hotel.\nWhy weren't we ever upgraded to a strip view especially when we were not even put in our room until well past check in time? Why didn't anyone take control of the situation and try to resolve it? Why not have us sit and wait in the Vdara Bar having cocktails and snacks to make it an enjoyable experience?\nBy the time we got to the room and had our luggage brought up, it was well past 4:00. When we finally got to the room it did not have a view of the strip as we had requested. Basically we were looking at and hearing the highway. We could not believe it as we paid for an eight night stay at a Premium 5-Star Hotel Penthouse Suite and spent a significant amount of money to stay in this Penthouse Suite. We have received better accommodations and service at much lower priced hotels in Las Vegas, such as The Signature where we actually had a strip view and a balcony, and were also accommodated on an early check-in with no problems within a reasonable amount of time of arriving. We had to call three days in a row asking for coffee and water, as we were only provided the bare minimum of water and decaffeinated coffee instead of regular coffee. The first time we asked for coffee we were told that there were only three regular caffeinated Keurig coffees left, so we were given the last three. Wow, running out of regular coffee?\nThey also will bring you an arrival gift - Ours was a bowl with four tiny pieces of rotten fruit versus the Signature, where our gift was a large basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne.\nWe observed housekeeping cleaning rooms as late as 5:00 pm, when the turn-down service was shortly after that...just didn't make sense. There were days we left by 9:00 am and turned on the housekeeping light so they could come in and clean, and we would come back late in the afternoon (3 - 5 p.m.) and things still were not done.

I like to travel with my dogs and Vdara advertises being dog friendly. I called them before I made any reservation to get detailed information on their pet policy. \n\nThey told me that they provide dishes and crates for the dogs so I wouldn't have to bring my own. \n\nI drove there so I could have easily brought my puppy's cage and dishes for my dogs. However, since I was told I wouldn't need either I didn't bring any of them with me. \n\nAfter I checked in, exhausted from my long drive 2 tiny crates arrived at my room. The hotel says up to 2 dogs combined weight per room 70lbs. The crates they brought were too tiny for my 43lb Springer and my 30lb puppy could be crammed in but couldn't lay down or sit comfortably. \n\nThey delivered blankets, a bisquit and a room service menu but no baggies as promised and no bowls. So I called downstairs 4 times to get no answer and went down to speak to them finally. I was told they only had paper dishes and no larger crates. \n\nObviously the paper dishes are not so reuse able with water and difficult to clean from food too so I had to ask for a new set the following day and didn't even get real dog dishes, no attempt was even made to give a a real bowl from room service. \n\nThen my second night the puppy got stuck in the tiny crate and suddenly 2 different size larger crates appeared at my door after being told many times that they had nothing larger. \n\nMy dogs were dying of thirst the entire stay and everytime I needed to feed them was a project.

No waitress came over to us even it was not many guest at the bar. There was a bartender pointed us the way and told us to seat ourselves while I could see there were several waitresses standing behind him doing nothing.  After we sat down for a while, no one came over to us to say anything. My husband saw a waitress brought a drink to the table behind me and she even looked at him but still didn't come over or say anything to us. We stayed another two minutes and waiting to order some drinks. After several minutes, still no one came over. My husband said this was ridicious and we left. Then we got some drink and cake at the market located across the bar.

Though this hotel does not have its own casino, its sister property Aria, with its casino and many bars and restaurants, is only a short walk away.  \n\nWe had a corner suite with a spectacular view of Aria and surrounding areas.  Amenities of our suite included:\n\n*A kitchen area complete with refrigerator and small dining area/table.\n\n*Small living room space with a sofa, flat screen television, and coffee table.\n\n*Spacious bathroom with dual vanities, soaking tub, make-up counter/area, generous closet space, and a roomy stand-up shower.\n\n*Push button controls for the blinds/shades for the entire room.  Very convenient and helpful.....there was just a wee bit of difficulty locating all the various controls.\n\n*Complimentary (and very comfortable) bath slippers.\n\nOverall, I liked our suite very much.  The kitchen and living room areas were a very decent size, while the bathroom was much larger than I expected.  There was also a placard in the kitchen area stating that kitchen utensils and accessories (pots, pans, etc), were available on request.  As far as the bed is concerned, it was soft and extremely comfortable.  \n\nI feel my only gripe about the room is that we had some difficulty, initially, locating all the controls for the blinds.  Also, I did wonder why two doors were given access to the bathroom (one from the bedroom and the other via the kitchen).  I thought that was a bit odd, though the door access from the kitchen could be locked from inside the bathroom.  Lastly, there was a slightly vinegar odor in the room when we arrived, and so maintenance was sent up to the room with an air purifier type device.  Thankfully, the smell disappeared later that night.\n\nLastly, some hotel amenities I took advantage of were the Starbucks and convenience store/coffee shop in the lobby.  I commend the baristas at the Starbucks, as they exhibited much teamwork the morning I visited.  Adversely, the store is part coffee shop and part convenience store.  You're able to order pastries and coffee, while there is a self service section for water, juices, sodas, snacks, etc.  Items are a bit pricey, but hey, you're paying for the convenience after all.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A pleasant 3-night stay at the Vdara Hotel.

This review is based on my most recent visit to Vdara (during the Thanksgiving week).\nI had stayed in Vdara in the past and had nothing but good things to say about the resort - good rates, cleanness, great service, amazing view, perfect deco, location etc.\n\nEver since we stayed in Vdara (we've stayed practically everywhere else on the strip and Aria was our favorite so far), we don't even bother looking into other hotels since.  Sometimes a bad hotel experience could ruin the entire trip, so this had saved us a lot of time and effort searching for a place to stay whenever we visit LV (I usually go to LV at least 2~3 times a year).\n\nHowever, our most recent visit ended in disaster after we had encountered... BED BUGS (or it could be some other type of bugs).  It is hard to believe that there could be bed bugs in a resort such as this, even I had doubts... but it happened.\n\nWe had stayed 3N/4D and on the second night, I folded out the sofa bed and slept on it.  In the morning next day, I had noticed certain rashes on both of my legs and on my friend's stomach (her daughter also had rash on her thighs - they both used the sofa bed to watch TV the night before).  We first thought it might be something in the linens and asked the housekeeping to look into it before going out to lunch.  Although we had requested for housekeeping on three different ways - 1) left the housekeeping light \"on\", 2) notified the housekeeping who came by earlier that we need it during lunch, and 3) requested to the front desk while waiting for valet.\n\nHowever, when we had returned to our room, the housekeeping still had not come by yet.  Once we called, they came after almost an hour wait and we had to wait for another half hour or so waiting for them to finish.  Later that night, my rash had gotten worse and it even started to bleed in certain places.  Then it started to sting and the pain was unbearable... it literally felt like I was being stung by dozens of bees at once.  My gf suggested that I filled the tub with warm water and put my legs in for a while, which eased the pain a bit.  Other still had minor rashes, but mine was the worst (I was the only one who slept on it all night).  Once the pain had gotten little better, I spent the last night of my trip sleeping on the floor (everybody was too tired and we didn't want to bother switching rooms or deal with it since we were leaving the next morning).\n\nNext day when I was checking out, I made a quick visit to the front desk to notify what had happened and showed them the pictures of my leg which I had taken over the night before.  The front desk called the manager because this was a \"security protocol\" who had asked me to make a statement with their security dept.  We were on our way out and the valet had already pulled out our car so we were in a hurry but they said it will only take a minute so I decided to wait.  While waiting for the security officer the manager took off the resort fees as courtesy... SERIOUSLY?!  I was in pain all night and practically ruined my last night of our trip and he took $28/day off for our stay?!  The funny thing is that when I headed to the front desk, I was not expecting any kind of comp because of this, I solely did it because we thought it's something they should be aware of.  But when they took off the resort fee and made it seem like it was a huge comp they were giving us, then the whole thing just felt like an insult.  On top of that, we had waited for over 15 minutes and the security officer still had not shown up.  I told the front desk that we need to leave, and she had offered that she'll have someone call me for the statement shortly.  The funny thing is that it's been weeks and I still haven't received a call for a statement.  And it was the hotel who NEEDED the statement, not me.\n\nWe really did enjoy staying in Vdara in the past and there's a good chance that we'll most likely stay there on our next trip, but the most recent stay/incident made it seem very difficult to make such decision easily nor recommend to others (which I have done so since we first stayed).  \n\nAgain, it really is a great hotel with exception qualities but I do not recommend using their sofa bed or if you do, just keep an eye out if you noticed unusual rash or marks on your skin soon after."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "L'Vette", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-9", "review": "I will keep this short and very sweet.

Not standard, but don't hesitate to ask ! \n\nOur room was on the 33rd floor, was very spacious and had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip. We had several friends staying in Vegas at the same time all over the strip, and we by far had a better room and view. Bed was soft, but comfortable. Nice large bathroom, with separate shower and bathtub. Large kitchenette, with mini bar, refrigerator, microwave and something like a stove (hotplate set up). Also has a table and two chairs if you choose to dine in. Living area with sofa and chair, coffee table and separate TV from the one in the sleeping area. Overall, large, beautiful, and clean room. \n\nThe Vdara is part of the city center, and it can be hard to navigate your way to the Strip. We made the mistake of going through Aria a few times and it takes forever. We quickly learned that the hotel has a walkway to the Bellagio, and it put us in a much better position on the strip. On average, it took about 10 minutes to get from the hotel through the Bellagio walking, no more than 20 minutes to get to the Flamingo/Bally's.\n\nIf you want to be in the center of all the action, this hotel is not for you. But if you want a beautiful, relaxing place to go back to after a day or night out in Vegas, than stay here !

What was uncommon was having an establishment, NOT Vdara, overdraft my account by $1500.  As a result, the day I was to leave I had no cash, and obviously, no money in my account.  I was unable to get a cab to the airport... problematic.  After trying multiple ways to use other forms of payment, Ben, the man who calls the taxis for guests, calls one up and pays for my ride to the airport.

I would stay there again.\n\nROOM:\nMy room was beautiful, and HUGE. I had an enormous (presumably king size) bed, and I heard the, yes, sofa in an adjoined \"room\" divided from the bed area by the TV floor-to-ceiling cabinet, and the desk. There was a kitchen area also, even with a cooktop, though I did not see any cookware, and, there was no grocery type store that i saw near the hotel. A Walgreen's that was supposedly nearby, but which took me hours to get to, going through the Cosmopolitan casino, which I heard took another fellow at the hotel, about the same amount of time to find. The room had free wifi, which was good. POOL: Its pool was closed for the week I was there, which I'd have appreciated knowing before I reserved a room there. There was also no sign at the pool area saying it was closed. I found this out while 2 other people were trying to get into the pool area as I was, by visiting the concierge who told me it was closed for the week. I let him know there was no sign there. I was able to use the pool area in its sister hotel Aria for the week, but that cut out on my lunch time taking 15-ish minutes to walk back and forth for my lunch hours at the conference, not great.\n\nCONCIERGE:\nI was here while the bull riding championships were in town, which I have always wanted to see. So I asked the concierge if tickets were easy to get, and was told they were sold out and I'd need to go through a ticket broker and they were really expensive, which seems like an odd thing for a concierge to say to a hotel guest, versus getting the price for me and offering to get the tickets for me. Later, another guest told me there were plenty of tickets, and they were \"cheap,\" so I am not sure what was true, and sadly to me, I didn't see this event I'd always wanted to go to for amusement. It always cracks me up watching it on TV.  ;)\n\nFOOD:\nThe hotel has some food at the bar, and a deli type place where you can get decent and expensive breakfasts and other meals, and it also has plenty of takeout options. You are able to get any of their foods as take out. I saw an older gentleman in a suit at a table, receive his breakfast in a takeout box, saw him explain he was eating in (and he was seated at a table), and saw the server bring him a plate to transfer the food to from his takeout box. I was surprised seeing this given the cost of the entree, that they didn't take it back and plate it for him -- that seemed surprisingly shoddy. \n\nThe quality of the food was fine, not particularly notable for the eggs Benedict. Its breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were not at all crisp, which I like to see in a breakfast potato. The takeout cobb salad was generous though, so that was good. The biscuits and gravy I'd skip, even though usually I love this dish. It featured sausage that was in casing, then cut up which was odd, so that got screwed up in the gravy, and the biscuits were unusual, soaking up the gravy instead of acting how biscuits in gravy normally \"act\". Not sure of the words to use, but that dish I cannot recommend, here. I did not have lunch or dinner here so cannot comment.\n\nThere is a Starbucks in the lobby also, and had prices that were okay. I was in a Starbucks in a Hilton in San Diego a few days later, featuring prices about 25% higher, so the prices at the Vdara's Starbucks were decent, for Vegas.\n\nLOCATION:\nOverall though, it's a very nice hotel. And, a BIG plus; they don't allow smoking here, because they don't have a casino!!  That is pretty huge. All other hotels feature casinos, and this one is adjacent to the Bellagio's casino so it's still closeby if you want to gamble. Their sister hotel, Aria, also has a bunch of other restaurants pretty close, across a giant valet circle drive, about a 5 minute walk away, but has a casino too. And Cosmopolitan hotel / casino is about a 6-7 minute walk away, going outside, down stairs or there's an elevator, and walking across its giant circular valet drive, but crossing some treacherous lanes of traffic also -- not friendly to do, but not really far, per se.\n\nOverall though, I liked the hotel very much.

I chose Vdara because the price was relatively cheap compared to the other hotels and had what I wanted which was a large tub for me to soak in. Vdara is also smoke-free and without a casino, though Aria is in walking distance if you want either option. There is also free wifi for guests (included in resort fees). You just have to put in your last name and room number. It worked great when I was streaming Netflix.\n\nI had to look up how to get to Vdara because I had never been there before and the map and directions were on the website. Turn left on Harmon if you're coming in from the south then follow the signs to the hotel. It can get a little confusing, but I managed. Vdara only has valet parking, but it's complimentary and that's what I did with my car. From the valet to the front desk, everyone was very friendly and enthusiastic. The person at the front desk was efficient checking me in and asked if I wanted a room on a low floor or high floor. I wanted high for the view and got a room on the 50th floor.\n\nThe room itself was huge and had a mini fridge as well as a kitchenette if I wanted to cook (I didn't, but always good to have). The window shades are controlled by a remote that is on the wall between the kitchen and the bedroom. The view? Amazing. My room was located where I could see the south end of the Strip.\n\nI had always wanted to order room service and decided this was the time to do it. I ordered Organic Airline Chicken and two sides: Mushroom and Herb Risotto and Sauteed Spinach. It took about half an hour to arrive and when it did, the person who brought it was friendly. She came into the room and placed my food on the table in the kitchen along with a flower vase. At first glance, I thought \"Oh no, the chicken is smaller than the sides it came with!\" However, I couldn't even finish my meal and had to save it for the next day. Both the spinach and risotto were delicious, no complaints, but the chicken, while crispy and yummy, was just a tad on the side of salty. Still good though.\n\nBonus: As a Vdara guest, I was offered a 40% discount to watch the cirque de soleil show Ka. I've been wanting to watch a cirque de soleil show since forever because I've never been to one before, but I especially wanted to watch Ka.

There were two minor things that I didn't like, but didn't really detract from my experience. One was that, because I had a room on the higher floors, I had to take those super fast elevators that my ears did not appreciate whatsoever. Also on my second day, I had gone out to eat breakfast and lunch, but housekeeping never showed up in my room. That was fine. However, when I went to watch Ka at MGM Grand late in the afternoon and came back, I was disoriented because I couldn't turn on the lights (housekeeping had turned off the lights using the master switch which I didn't use) and everything was cleaned up. Including my makeup on the bathroom counter which got organized. I honestly didn't expect housekeeping to show up so late in the day and it wasn't a nice surprise because I wasn't expecting it.\n\nIf I ever decide to do another staycation, Vdara is definitely a hotel reservation option.

The front desk was busy when we called btw, so we didn't get through to complain. #2 The lack of self park services is just plain stupid.

This is probably one of my favorite places to stay, and I think the Vdara has some of the most breathtaking views out of all the hotels in Vegas.  Our group of friends recently stayed in a suite, which had a queen size bed and pull out couch. We had awesome kitchen accommodations, including a water filter inside the refrigerator. Other basic kitchen amenities included microwave, stove, sink, refrigerator, freezer, and plenty of storage space for drinks and snacks. \n\nThe major downside was the bathroom, which is a central part to getting ready for a night in Vegas. The features inside the bathroom were awesome, though. We had two sinks, a bathtub, standing shower, toilet, aaaaand a separate full mirror with plenty of counterspace for doing makeup, hair, and whatever else people do in front of a mirror. However, all of this is enclosed behind two doors, so technically, only one person can be in the bathroom at once if they are using the toilet, tub, or shower... unless your group members are super comfortable with each other. Plus, our sliding door was broken, so that was awkward.\n\nThe bedroom has a plasma TV, which was useful for watching movies in the morning or bumping music at night. The hallways and walking spaces are a bit cramped in the suite, but if you don't have too many people moving around, it's not too big of a problem. Room service is good, and they are quick to bring us any additional amenities upon request.

I've been to Vegas a couple of times, but both times, I've stayed on Caesar's, which has been more than excellent. \n\nMy issue with the Bellagio began with the bellman. I was asked three times when I was wheeling my luggage into the hotel (all one bag) if they could grab it. I politely told them 'No thank you.' They all responded by making a snide sound or rolling their eyes or throwing their hands in the air. Totally unprofessional. \n\nThe next issue was the most major, because it reinforced the idea of the Bellagio that I got upon my arrival - that the employees are snobs. I played Craps countless times, and the dealers were just flat out rude, especially when I would have bets taken down and cashed out (I would imagine because I was up). This happened on three different occasions with 3-4 different employees. One was a higher up with a tie, overseeing a chip deposit to our table. \n\nMy next issue was the room itself. The temperature would not adjust. The room is a smokehouse, and while the temperature reads 65, there is no way it is above 73.\n\nNext was the food. Every place I ate at (that was a quick grab -  not a restaurant) was twenty minutes to fill an order. It shouldn't take that long to make a pastrami on rye sandwich! This occurs multiple times.\n\nHaving had very positive experience at Caesar's, I don't know if I'll ever return to the Bellagio, and that just isn't to stay, I will no longer gamble there either (for the rest of my trip, I'll be gambling at Caesar's or somewhere else). \n\nI hope that someone reads this because the Bellagio is such a beautiful hotel. Everything is set up to be perfect. Some of the employees aren't executing it like they should be and it's ruining the experience."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "2", "name": "Wendy", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-10-20", "review": "I had such high expectations of the Bellagio that the overall experience was somewhat disappointing.

Now on to the cons: we stayed in a nonsmoking room yet our floor still wreaked of smoke, the room left much to be desired (for what we paid we assumed the room would be grander than it was) but the worst part and the reason I won't be back is because of the bed. It was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in. Hard as a rock, the floor might have been softer. I woke up every morning with my body in pain (and I'm in my 30s).

I called the manager to tell them they had charged me 3x all he said was they would put the money back in 10 days. We didn't enjoy our first time in Vegas and it was all mainly because of the bellagio. Don't be fooled by the name. And to top it all off we reserved a table with bottle service at the bank night club and they wanted to force us to buy 2 bottles of sky vodka for 1,500 dollars. We only wanted to buy one so they kicked us out of the club with security. PLEASE IF U WANT GREAT SeRViCE DO NoT STAY AT THE BELLAGIO.

Their group sales department is slow to respond at times, has a hug lag time to update the rooming list if check-in/check-out dates are adjusted, and they lack of follow through is horrible i.e. to ask for the proper credit card authorization forms from their customers is a step completely missed in my process. They do not seem to truly care about you as a customer and we spent approximately 20,000 within 2 nights and 3 days between 26 people (company-wide, we were 58 in attendance). The only way I would ever book a group event here again is if the conference was here. I would much rather be at one of the newer venues or at the convention center. Additionally, I gave them plenty of time for follow up as everyone makes mistakes or gets busy but they just didn't care about the mistakes that happened with our group reservations.  Additionally, this review is not based on their rooms or facilities - it is merely based on my experience with their group sales department  and on that note alone, I would not personally visit this casino or resort again, and will avoid them for group travel as much as possible --- only if I absolutely have to book people here in other words."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Rebecca", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-4", "review": "We stayed in a premier fountain view room.

Disgusting rooms for a lot of money!  My husband and I recently stayed here for his 35th birthday for one night.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge on the room (nearly $350 for a king, fountain view room - that's with the M Life discount).  We live in AZ and typically visit Vegas 4 times per year, so this was not our first time here.  \n\nOur first room was 16070.  Upon walking in, the room reeked of mildew.  It smelled like the carpet had been flooded for weeks and then dried off and put back to use.  We called the front desk and they moved us very quickly to a different room just down the hall (16048).  This room did not smell....or so we thought.  After being out and about and returning to our room after midnight, we just wanted a good night's rest.  We climbed into bed and realized that the sheets and bedding all reeked of mildew as well!!!  DISGUSTING!!!  Seeing as it was so late and we were exhausted, we did not want to call housekeeping and wait for them to strip our seats or have to pack up and move rooms once again.  So, we both slept uncomfortably fully clothed.  Isn't the purpose of a hotel to provide a comfortable night's stay?\n\nAlso, if you choose to stay in a fountain room, they do not tell you that you will hear the music from Drai's day and night club across the street at the Cromwell all day and all night long (until 4am).  It would have been nice for someone just to inform us of this and give us a chance upon check-in to switch rooms.  \n\nI called guest relations to complain about my stay.  What did they offer me?  An upgrade to a junior suite for 2 nights if I came back and paid to stay in a standard room.  This is just ridiculous.  I would never return to the Bellagio for $350 per night ever again.  I was never offered any type of discount or compensation for my horrible experience.  This hotel is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.

But the overall experience was exactly what was expected and I wouldn't change anything. I definitely recommend staying here. Be prepared that the lines to check in are very long, though (as they are at all popular casinos). It seems to be a little bit smokier here, too.

Their attention to detail was stunning, and there were so many unique aspects of it that still remain today: the conservatory, the ceiling art at the reception desk, the art gallery, the fountains, their approach to dining, etc.  \n\nSadly, time has caught up with the Bellagio a bit, and it has lost some of its luster.  As other reviewers have noted, you might see cracks in the facade, tears in the carpet, or have the occasional bad service experience.  It's like going back to Disney World as an adult, where the magic you may remember from years ago just isn't the same now.  \n\nWith that said, pound for pound, the Bellagio still offers the most things for the most people.  It has great pools, gambling (though note that table minimums are slightly higher than most places on The Strip), shopping, shows, gelato!, and more non-gambling activities than most.  It has the perfect location, where it's in the middle of everything.  If you're coming with a diverse group of people (maybe a family gathering with lots of age groups?) who will meet for dinner but otherwise have completely separate vacation experiences, the Bellagio is probably perfect for you.  \n\nIt saddens me a bit to only give the Bellagio 4 stars... it's kind of the #2 resort on every category though.  The newer hotels have a narrower focus than the Bellagio, so they can win on dining or shopping or pool or gambling or scent or room quality etc.  They're all \"OR\"s though, as newer places have probably learned from the Bellagio just how hard and expensive it is to try to be #1 at everything."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "C", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-11-11", "review": "Excellent experience.

I still hold it in high regard and think it is one of the best hotels on the Strip. But after having stayed there for a weekend, the romance has worn off, it's just another hotel, and I doubt I will ever stay here again.\n\nI wanted a transformative experience, impeccable service, and memorable experiences that confirmed what I had always believed The Bellagio to represent.\n\nBut alas, I came away with more than a couple of sub-par experiences.\n\nThroughout our entire stay, this hotel was super busy. At any hour. The minute we got out of our elevator, there were hoards of people, of course it was worse at night. If you want a little space wandering your hotel, this is not the place to stay.\n\nI had two nights booked, separately so I called ahead to make sure the reservations could be combined and we wouldn't need to change rooms. But we showed up and still had to have the reservations combined into one stay. And even that didn't stick. The next day we were locked out of our room mid-day because the keys for the first reservation stopped working. A 10 minute wait and security let us into our room. A call to the front desk brought a promise of new keys, delivered within 30 minutes. An hour later, no keys. Another call and the front desk said, \"you'd better come down to get them\". Worse, the front desk clerk giggled at me when I told her I'd had to wait an hour for naught. No apology. Not a big deal, right? Keys can be a problem, no? I agree, it's how it was handled.\n\nOur room was nice, but not spectacular. The room we paid for could have been on any floor between 9 and 28. We were on floor 11. That was disappointing. The front desk clerk should have listened when I told him I had wanted to stay here for many many years, he could have provided us the best possible experience, but no, he didn't. The room was well done, nothing out of place (apart from a bag of mini bar snacks left opened). The bathroom was the best part, large with a nice-sized glass shower. I was also disappointed that our view of the fountains could only be taken in when we huddled by the window; I'd wanted to sit in bed and watch the show!\n\nWe spent some time by the pool. It was early November and not that warm, but we weren't the only ones there. Service was non-existent! Others were served but no staff ever came to ask for our order.\n\nWe faced the Fountains (Fountain Deluxe Room) and one terribly surprising aspect of our room was noise! Between midnight and 4 AM both nights during our stay, noise from the club in the hotel woke me up. Thump thump thump for a few hours. Another surprise was noise in the hallway. Both nights there were very loud groups of people hanging out in the hallway for more than a few minutes. I probably should have called the front desk. It was just surprising for a hotel of this quality that there was so much noise coming from outside (the nightclub was directly below our room) and inside (the hallway).\n\nOur housekeeper was the same person over three days. She was very kind and gracious. We sought her out when we left to thank her for her service.\n\nPerhaps when one day money becomes no object, I will return to The Bellagio. But for the immediate future, there are many nice hotels along the Strip that will provide just as comfortable accommodations for a much fairer price. I'd really hoped, spending such a considerable sum, that we would have been treated as special, valued guests, but we weren't, we were just a couple of other guests in a huge hotel on a busy weekend."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Sam", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-11-24", "review": "That place is cool! always play there whenever i go to Vegas!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Benjamin", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-26", "review": "Really can't complain about this hotel.

The fountain shows are approximately 15 minutes apart and run even into the night.\n\n2. You can find comps and room deals both on smartervegas.com and through the MyVegas facebook/iphone app.\n\n3. There are quite a few famous restaurants in Bellagio and among them in Sensi, check them out near the Bellagio garden exhibits.\n\n4. Bellagio boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the world at their installment of Jean Phillipe Patisserie.\n\n5. They are the last stop on a short tram between the Monte Carlo, Aria, Vdara, and Bellagio with an entrance a little past the gift shop area towards the conference room area.\n\nBellagio is an iconic hotel. Featured in so many TV shows to movies (remember Ocean's!?) and has been around for quite some time. The hotel is loved by many because of the beautiful fountains that go on a water show every few minutes to the fact that they are a 5 star luxury hotel.\n\nThe hotel campus boasts some of the best views on the strip. They are located almost in the middle of the action across from the equally beautiful, but dated Paris Las Vegas and next to the Cosmopolitan and Aria. \n\nThere are many things to do besides gambling when staying at the Bellagio. Their pool is rather famous for its collection of fun fountains to swim under to the more refined atmosphere of other pool goers. I also can't stop raving about their exhibits that they change up every few months. We are about to visit for Christmas and can't wait to see how they've transformed the Bellagio gardens area. \n\nBesides the gardens and the pool, Bellagio is sandwiched between two high end shopping areas. The Crystals shopping center is reachable by a short tram ride and the Bellagio is connected to its own series of shops.\n\nOne of the main attractions of Bellagio is heading to \"O\" the highly acclaimed cirque du soleil show. I've personally never been to the show due to its price, but it comes highly recommended from friends who have been wowed by the experience.\n\nAnd, of course, I can't forget to mention their own wonderful places to have food. From Jean Phillipe Patisserie which boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the United States and the best cheap eats such as pressed chicken basil paninis, to the more upscale Sensi restaurant, these are all awesome places to check out. Their buffet needs a little updating, but it's still a good stop for those who want to try it.\n\nNow, why after this pretty much gushing review does Bellagio only deserve 4 stars? Well, the rooms are still pretty dated and a little less advanced then the newer Aria Las Vegas. I think that the price point for the Bellagio is a bit too high. They probably estimate the value of their rooms based on the fact that it is one of the most iconic landmarks on the strip.\n\nStill, I prefer the rooms over at the Aria.

In my opinion, it was one of the premiere properties in Vegas. Key word: WAS. I wanted to get an upgraded room for a recent business trip to Vegas in early October. I was attending a lecture series at the Bellagio and I booked a fountain view room for 4 nights. Check in was fast. The art installation in the lobby was new and I couldn't wait to check it out. It is one of my favorite reasons for visiting the property. I was really getting excited about my stay. It wasn't until that evening that things started going downhill. I'm not sure if it is the Bellagio's club or one across the street, but the bass from the sound system kept us awake until 4am. I called the front desk to ask them if they were aware that the bass was so loud, it rattled our windows. I don't remember if they apologized or not, but they didn't have any rooms to move us to. The next day, I was so exhausted from not sleeping that I couldn't focus on the lectures being given. I missed a good portion of the day because I went to my room to take a nap. \n\nThat evening, the bass started again. I knew my ability to pay attention to the next day's lectures would be a disaster like the first so I decided to check out in the morning and head home.

Even though I checked out, they continued to charge my card for the next two days!! I contacted them about the charges and they said they would credit me the days back. I got my credit card statement and they attempted to steal $65 from me still!! I called and the lady at the front desk said, \"That was dumb of us to charge you for 2 days of resort fees even though you weren't here.\" No apology. \n\nYou can stay and play, but you better keep your eye on your credit card bill. After my last visit, I don't think the Bellagio is as nice as it used to be. Even the crowd seemed more down-dressed.

Prior to this during the 90's there were a bunch of unfortunate family oriented resorts opening up all over the place (New York, New York, Treasure Island, the very venerable Excalibur) all of which were forgetting that the first megacasino, The Mirage, made no attempt to try to court little kids because.... KIDS DON'T GAMBLE, DRINK or EAT (WELL)!  The Bellagio put the nail in the coffin of that nonsense and forever there on out the city has transformed into something far more aligned with the original spirit of the city than annoying families and $1.99 prime rib dinners.\n\nUnfortunately these days the Bellagio is a mixed bag and it's pretty much divided straight down the line between staying there and just going there to have fun with other resort amenities.  Just to get the key negatives out of the way fast: unless you're high rolling the standard rooms here are now pretty dated and not recommended at all in contrast to pretty much any of the new resorts.  If you haven't been to Vegas before I *know* you've seen Ocean's 11 and the Bellagio looks pretty pimp but trust me, you can get a comparably priced room at places like the Aria, the Mandrian, the Cosmo and sometimes the Wynn (although usually it's a bit more expensive) that is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.  Unless they've recently renovated the rooms here are nothing special at all and definitely feel like they're from another era of Vegas.\n\nThe good news is that much of the rest of Bellagio is still very cool and worth you time.  I could be seeing things but I feel like the Bellagio has a lot more tables for you to play at than any other casino in Vegas so that's pretty cool.  I'll save this for another review but Picasso is still a fantastic fine dining establishment worth your hard won cash.  Olives is a good place to sit outside, see the water show and look at the strip (although the food is just okay!)  The Bellagio Buffet used to be the reigning champ of all you can gorge gluttony but I think it's been supplanted in recent years by the Wynn and the Cosmo (although I don't go to buffets much anymore so your tastes may vary!)\n\nSo, the short version: Visit this place but don't stay here."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Kevin", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-23", "review": "came here with my wife for a two night stay over the weekend in early December. \n\nThe hotel is spectacular and immaculate. Everything here from floor to ceiling was designed with great care and luxurious materials. The hotel is so large it does take some time to navigate back and forth to and fro from casino, parking, front desk, shops, etc. we got a king sized bed room in the spa tower. The room was very large, probably ~600 sq ft. Bathroom had a shower area and a tub with dual sinks. Room has a large led Samsung tv with very refined high end everything ( desk, sofa chairs, and linens - linens are very soft and comfy). Room has a bunch of snacks and drinks, and a locked mini fridge (not complimentary)\n\nWhile the hotel itself, it's location (middle of the busiest intersection on the strip), and it's grandness was amazing, the service was definitely sub par. This was the biggest disappointment because I've been looking forward to staying here for awhile. My story begins with the front desk, we were given a room after we checked in late on Friday near 7pm. The place was bristling with people but they checked us in quickly. However when we finally trekked to our room, there was a couple in that entered the room with luggage literally RIGHT in front of us in the hallway.... We didn't want to make the trek back to the lobby since it was far away so we called the Desk with the phones along the floor. They put us on hold for 3 to 5 minutes, which was frustrating considering we were pretty tired and saw how they can muck up assigning rooms to guests... They reassigned us to another room on a different floor and said our cards would work in the new room. So we again trekked to the other floor we were assigned, and Lo and behold, only one key worked......at least one worked, and we were able to get in... \n\nAfter we got settled we went back to the lobby and told them one of he keys didn't work and we told them what happened..... With no apologies, the lady who was helping us said.....this isn't supposed to be your room..... We were getting very frustrated now...because we weren't going to move or change rooms again...this was getting ridiculous.... After another 5 minutes she took our old cards and issued us new cards and said it should be fine now..... Without apologizing for any inconvenience. \n\nNow fast forward to check out day, we didn't have change to give to our cleaning person so wanted to break change. The gift shop next to the elevators in spa tower just said no without reason and told me to go to the casino for any change..... \n\nAdditionally multiple times I was stopped and asked for my room card going up to the guest elevators (sometimes with and without luggage and singled out amongst other guests)\n\nFor $300-$400 per night stay... its dissapointing to be treated like second class citizens and discriminated upon.\n\nStayed December 2014, traveled as a couple"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "1", "name": "JT", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-24", "review": "The front desk was exceptionally slow and rude.

She let us know it was their most recently remodeled tower.  She was also super helpful with info about restaurants and the free shuttle to the strip.  \n\nThe room itself was quite nice.  It was on a higher floor, very modern, clean, and had a huge window.  Yes, we were directly overlooking the parking garage, but the larger view was the Vegas strip, absolutely beautiful at night.  The armoire cabinet was a bit scratched up, could use a touch up.  But overall, everything was very clean and our bed was very comfortable.  Yes, the lighting could be better.  It was a bit confusing, and took us some playing around with the switches to figure out which switch worked for which lamp.  I also had to do my makeup by the window, because the lighting in the bathroom was practically non-existent.  The hotel could benefit from investing in brighter bulbs... \n\nDuring the day on the weekends, the lobby was bustling with very attractive people, many half-clothed headed to rehab pool.

The casino itself was tiny, and there was only one cocktail waitress that was impossible to order drinks from.  Eventually we headed to the circular bar in the main casino to grab drinks.  This too, made for some amazing people watching.  Between watching several \"working girls\" do their thing, and some old fool literally drunkenly fall of his bar stool, there was plenty of entertainment.  \n\nOur bartender was great.  A funny guy with glasses, he was attentive, and allowed me to taste one of the wines before ordering (they don't have a wine list, have a limited selection of wines at the that bar).  The wine was decent.  I later ordered a Patron Espresso, which they didn't have, but the manager overheard me ordering it and offered to check their other bar to see if they carried it.  He took a while to come back (probably distracted with whatever shenanigans were going on), so I ordered a second glass of wine.  He eventually did show up with the Patron, and offered me the drink for free.  Sweet.  They did have one bartender who was kind of a jerk, practically threw the matches at me when I asked for some.  But thankfully, the other bartender was great and we were able to order mostly from him.  \n\nI could see how this place might not be for everyone.  I saw a girl puking her guts out by the taxis.  On one evening, the elevator we took smelled like vomit and had a suspicious looking stain on the floor.  We arrived back at our hotel around 2:30 am and the casino was packed to the brim. This is not a family friendly hotel, but frankly, I don't think Vegas is all that family friendly to begin with.  (With all the sex and debauchery flying around, I would never bring my kids here if I had any...)\n\nDisappointed that the Pink Taco only has happy hour on particular days of the week.  We love the Pink Taco in LA, and were looking forward to grabbing some appetizers before heading out for the evening  Also, the ventilation in the rooms isn't always great.  Some idiot decided to smoke outside our room, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, and our entire room reeked of smoke for a while.  The shuttle only rides once an hour and until 5PM, and the max passenger seating is 20 ppl.

We will book The HRH Tower for our next visit.\nThe bartenders were incredible.  Phillip and Nick our all time favs.  Most everyone we came in contact with were very nice.  The center bar has a very trippy echo that stumped us the first couple days, but then figured out how to enjoy someone's conversation from the other side of the bar.  Pretty funny.\nSecurity in this hotel always seems to be comforting.  Nice work HR.\nYou can definitely see some wear and tear in the hotel, but over all a very nice stay.  \nThe pole dancers over the gaming tables are rad.  A show while you are gambling.  Those dancers were so strong and fun to watch.\nThe dealers are really nice as well.  Most all wanted you to win and are more than happy to help and chat.  We played BJ and craps most everyday.  The pit bosses were very friendly.\nCheck-in and out is super easy and welcoming.\nWe have rented a cabana at the nirvana pool twice.  A great way to spend a day if the weather is nice.\nI will rate the restaurants separately, but just need to mention that we have eaten at all establishments.  Culinary Drop out we visited multiple times.  It was that good and fun.\nAnd finally, one observation we made is how nice looking most people are in the casino.  There seemed to be a steady stream of 25-60 year old.  This hotel is not filled with old people or families with kids.  A perfect spot of the 40-something.  We will most definitely be back.

He noticed it was my birthday when he was looking at my license, and he put us in the HRH Tower, which is an all-suite wing of the hotel.  Awesome!  Thanks Ariel!\n\nThe room was awesome.  We were on the 3rd floor, which gave us a wonderful view of a roof and the parking garage ;), but who are we to complain?  The room was about 700-sq-ft, and had a separate living and bedroom area.  The beds were SUPER comfy!  The living room had a neat touchscreen music system on the wall, which was built in with all different genres of music that played through a speaker by the TV.  You could also plug in your own device, which was a nice touch.  The bathroom was great!  Double sinks, and a separate bathrub (huge) and shower (huge).  The shower had an awesome rainfall showerhead.\n\nWe did not check out too much of the property, but the separate check-in area for the HRH Tower was a nice touch, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.\n\nThe only downside was the confusion of the light system in the bathroom.  It was SO dark in there the first night, and we could barely see anything.  Obviously we could have called the front desk, but we were too tired.  We also couldn't figure out how to use the rain showerhead either, but the other showerhead was still great.  We did go by the front desk the second day, and the agent let us know that there was a master switch by the front door that controls the light in the bathroom.  Seems a little poorly designed and confusing.  He also sent up engineering to look at the showerhead, and they left us a note explaining how to use it.

Yet the room I received couldn't be called a suite by any stretch of the imagination.  It was an average hotel room, and no, having a sofa in a the room does not make it even a Jr. Suite. Plenty of hotel rooms have those.  So I have to say their advertising is pretty misleading.  But with that said, I paid about $40 for the room (during a huge convention none the less) so I cant complain too much.  It was a nice room -- very clean, all white and grey modern decor which I liked a lot.  Except I didnt enjoy the photo of Pete Wentz urinating on the wall next to the bed. Im pretty sure no one wants to look at that.\n\nThe hotel itself is pretty cool -- much smaller than most but I enjoyed the decor. It definitely screamed rock but not in a pretentious way.  The bar drinks were good but they need a drink menu with good, sweet drinks, and a bartender who is a bit more friendly.  The dining choices at the hotel are just okay -- I ended up walking across the street to get food most of the time.  And thats what I liked the most about staying there.  There's a strip mall across the street with Korean BBQ, Sushi, Indian Food, a Mexican Cantina, all of my favorites, not to mention a convenient CVS.\n\nI didnt have any problems with the staff. I did have issues with some of the douchebag, bro types who stay at places like this and think it's okay to harass women for just walking into the hotel.

I stayed at the Hard Rock over the weekend for my sister's bachelorette party shenanigans and I walked away feeling disappointed and angry. Not only is the hotel/casino depressing, the employees are so rude! Below are a few examples of the employees having bad attitudes:\n\n1. The hotel has a new policy that bell hops are not allowed to bring food or beverages up to the room for you. That's lame but whatever. The bell hop we had was very matter of fact about it and unapologetic. He acted annoyed and he was a total jerk when we pressed him for more information about it.\n\n2. We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and requested the rooms be near each other if not right next to each other. When we checked in we asked to make sure they were near each other and they were not. They were on complete opposite sides of the tower. When we asked if we could have them next to each other the gentleman at the check-in desk said it was really busy and they were still trying to get rooms together. We said that was ok and we could wait until 2 rooms next to each other were ready and he said \"Well it could be 1 hour or it could be 5 hours. I have no idea so I don't know what to tell you.\" SO UNHELPFUL and not very accommodating at all.\n\n3.. Our friend called down to the bell desk to ask for her luggage and they said they weren't very busy so it would only be about 15 minutes.. It was clearly taking longer to she called down to check on it. My friend: \"Hi I'd like to follow up on my luggage. It's been about 30 minutes since I called down and you said it would be up in 15 minutes.\" Bell desk: \"Actually it's only been 27 minutes! We're very busy so you're going to have to wait!\" uuhhh.....what?\n\n4. We were getting ready to go out for the night and the bride-to-be wanted to grab a quick appetizer before we started to drink a lot so we went into Pink Taco. There were about 9 of us girl and we decided that rather than get a table we would just sit at the bar. The bar only had about 3 other people at it so there was plenty of room for us. Only a few of us were going to be eating and the rest of the girls wanted to get a drink while we waited for them. When the 4 girls who were going to eat asked for a menu at the bar the bar tender looked at the other bartender, rolled his eyes and said \"what the hell is this!\" and walked away...leaving the other bartender to help us. We were all ordering drinks...we were all paying customers...I'm so confused as to why the bar tender was annoyed that a few of the girls wanted to eat.  Then one of the girls needed a paper napkin so she asked the bartender if she could get a few napkins.  He looked at her with eyes of disgust, picked up the linen napkin that was in front of her, and proceeded to dangle it in front of her face like she was an idiot and didn't know it was there. When she actually just needed a paper napkin so that's why she asked for one.\n\n5. We went into The Ainsworth, which is a little lounge type bar inside the casino. One of my friends ordered a drink from the bar and the total was $7.00. She gave the bartender a $20 bill and the bartender only gave her $8.00 back. The money was sitting on the bar and before she even reached to put it away she told the bartender \"Oh, I think you forgot to the other $5.00\" since the change was supposed to be $13.00.  The bartender said \"Oh really?!?!\" in a very condescending tone and then said \"Let's check the cameras then!\" My friend was absolutely dumbfounded. The guy standing next to her backed up her claim, that she was given the wrong change. But the bartender denied it. When my friend asked for a manager and tried to explain what happened and let him know the bartender was treating her unfairly, he refused to help her at all. He did end up giving her the $5.00 she was owed, but only after 15 minutes of arguing about it.\n\nI do have to mention, though, that the maid we had was the nicest person on the planet and we loved her.

But hey, I stay on the Strip because that is where the best times are!! Sure there are a lot of drunk, loud college kids- my group included. Everything is overpriced, which is why I bring my own bottled water and beer thank you. I would rather pay through the nose and be in the middle of it all than stay off strip and make up the difference in cab fare. \n\nWhen I saw the prices at this hotel I was pretty stoked for my Labor day get away. I have stayed at MGM, NYNY and Luxor and LOVED this area of the strip. Mostly younger people just having a good time. So I booked the room. \n\nUpon arriving at the hotel I was met by a saleslady at the door announcing she had my welcome gift. Having never experienced this before, I thought it was just a nice gesture but the little voice in my head reminded me \"this is Vegas, nothing is free\". So my group of 3 guys and myself spent about 10 minutes being talked to about show tickets before we realized it was a hustle. I figured it was a one time thing, but by the end of the trip we literally were running past the doors to not get hassled. HOW ANNOYING! \n\nWe check in and are told we are on the 2nd floor. Kind of a bummer, because let's face it, I love the lights and a good view makes the room. I don't say anything and get to the room hoping we at least are looking at the Luxor.. I opened my window and to my dismay we were 5 feet from a brick wall. Yes seriously- a window facing another part of the hotel building. \n\nWe went about our first night hanging out and walking the casino. I crashed earlier because I had been up so early to finish packing while my boyfriend and his friend stayed out drinking. I woke up about 6 am the following day feeling itchy. I go to the bathroom and turn on the light and there is a HUGE BEDBUG on my leg. I freaked out and killed it, noticing bites on my leg and both my feet. I immediately wake up everyone in the room and call the front desk. They proceed to send a security guard up who is pretty nonchalant like this is an every day occurrence.\n\nThey switch us to another room after many pictures are taken and in the new room we notice it is REALLY dirty. I mean not the average, partied in Vegas room dirty, but dried boogers on the sheets nasty dirty. We asked the manager for yet another room and she came through with a really nice suite for us. That is the only reason this place gets 2 stars. Take it from me, if you are going to stay here, buck up and get the suite. \n\nThe buffet was super cheap, and basically you get what you pay for, super cheap food. We went to the Wynn buffet one day and it was AWESOME. \n\nBasically if you are wanting the strip and want to gamble on getting bitten by bedbugs, stay in a standard room. For a nicer experience get a suite. For an even better time, stay at MGM, they know how to clean the rooms right!"}, {"type": "Negative Deceptive", "stars": "1", "name": "BA", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-10-6", "review": "This has to be the worst hotel I have stayed at.

This was probably the only sour point about my experience at this hotel. Our friends were behind us in line, so we were served first. When we went to check in our agent, Nina, said there were no kings left but that we could come down the next day and they would move us. There was some back and forth between her and the agent helping our friends and then we were all checked in and ready to go. Our friends came over and told us that they had been upgraded to a King room. At which point I was like wtf? We went upstairs and lo and behold, they had NOT been upgraded, their agent had lied to them. Not impressed with that.\n\nThe next day we did go back down and Kathy was happy to help us switch and was very prompt at doing so. We didn't have to give back our old keys, just leave them in our room and we were able to move immediately. Our new room had a strip view, which was nice, and a king bed and was as well appointed as our previous room.\n\nOne thing with this hotel is the noise. Because you're on the strip, non strip view rooms will be quieter. I'm a light sleeper and I slept with earplugs every night, if not for the noise from the strip, for the noise from the air conditioner. Every single room we had (between four of us) had loud a/c units.\n\nThe hotel itself is pretty well situated, you really wouldn't have to leave if you didn't want to. The casino is spacious and I was able to play all the games I wanted to without having to wait long. I also found $100USD on the floor my first night :D Lucky me! The food court has some good options, starbucks, mcdonalds, krispy kreme, etc, and there's lots to see and do within the casino itself. Location wise, I would have preferred to be closer to the main part of the strip but you get what you pay for.\n\nThe only other bad thing at this hotel was constantly being hounded to go and see this new property they were pushing. \"We'll feed you and you'll tour the facility\" they said. \"We'll give you cheap show tickets\" they said. Very suspicious and my bullshit radar was up - avoid these guys like the plague, they'll hunt you down. After a while, we stopped admitting that we lived at the same address just so they'd leave us alone.\n\nOverall, this was a great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The slots were great, the amenities were good, the rooms were well appointed and fairly modern and it wasn't hard to get around. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for - we didn't want to spend a ton of money for four nights in Vegas, we wanted that money to go to gambling and shopping and eating. This was a reasonably priced, clean hotel. We didn't spend a ton of time in our rooms besides sleeping and changing and it suited us just fine."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "2", "name": "TOM", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-10-8", "review": "No WiFi on top floors u needed a laptop to whook up to internet via eather net cable who the he'll uses laptops anymore lol...toilet took 2 hours 2 fill up before used again....very out dated and dingy feeling hotel...

You either search 45 min for a surface parking spot or try your luck in the 3-story garage a mile from the hotel doors. Service was alright, wasn't rude and not a problem. Now, the room. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is absolutely awful, it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must. If you could book a non-smoking room there wasn't a mention of it. There was no wifi and there wasn't a channel guide for the TV. The TV also was not even close to HD. The beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap. This hotel also has the worst dining on the strip. A dicks last resort? Really? I know most hotels had fast food courts but fast food seemed the best the Excalibur could offer. As for a view, you either pay more for one of the strip or you get the parking lot or a brick wall. Cheap, tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place. The only redeeming qualities was that I heard they had a DQ and their pool. The extra $40 for a different hotel on the strip is absolutely worth it.

First, as we walked into the hotel to start four days of business travel, we were met by hawkers trying to get us to look at condos in return for show tickets. One of them actually took my wife by the arm and tried to lead her over to their kiosk. After dodging them, we walked a little further, and another shopkeeper stopped my wife and tried to convince her to buy eye cream. We finally got in line at registration and were happy to find only six parties in line ahead of us. After about fifteen minutes, the line had not moved. When it finally came time to register, we found out why the line moved so slowly, as we were upsold everything from Wi-Fi to spa packages. Speaking of Wi-Fi, it's $15 a day PER DEVICE, which is ridiculous considering that Vegas is a destination for many conventions...the reason for our stay. Our room was adequate..think Hampton Inn with a granite shower. Since we had been traveling for many hours and were still on Eastern time, and had to rise early for a morning meeting, we retired to bed around 9PM. At 11PM, our pictures and mirrors began shaking as a DJ at a club at the base of the Eiffel Tower about 100 yards from our room began playing Techno Dance music with subwoofers that must have been the size of a Dodge Caravan. Let me be clear, the Paris Hotel was playing loud music right outside their guests' rooms from 11PM-4AM. When we asked about this, we were told that we could request earplugs. One of the people who checked in with my company was told they could have a room with a view, but it would be loud, or, they could overlook the parking deck. I would like to have been in the business meeting where that decision was made. \"What can we do about the fact that the back of our hotel has a terrible view?\" \"How about we play loud music all night outside the rooms with a nice view just to even things out?\" \"Brilliant, Roberts!

The vibe was negative with several of them. It seemed to me that employee moral was low and no one was really in to it.

I have visited the casino in the past, so I already knew it's basic layout.  This was my first time staying in one of their rooms. I got a room with two queen beds and was pleased with the room size and cleanliness. The bathroom really impressed me with it's size and decor. I loved the separate tub and shower. The vanity had ample counter space for the standard array of ladies toiletries. I just wish hotels would equip their bathrooms with ventilation fans to help clear out the humidity and, um, other bathroom odors.\n\nThe TV is mounted to the wall, but it's way off center to accomodate the large armoire on the same wall. The armoire has two closet doors and three drawers to place clothing in. There is also a mini fridge in one of the cabinets in the armoire. I then realized the bathroom was so spacious because there was no built in closet, the armoire is your closet. It actually works because the armoire is French, and being the Paris hotel, it makes sense decor wise.\n\nThe beds were comfortable and the headboard was padded faux leather. It was nice because I often sit up in bed with my head resting against the headboard. The decorative pillows on the bed were too much though. Two very large brown velour covered pillows and one bolster pillow. So actually there were only two small pillows that had pillowcases on them to lay your head and sleep on. I wouldn't sleep on the velour ones as I doubt those get changed like the sheets do.\n\nThere is wi-fi included for two devices with the \"resort package\" which I think means the \"resort fee,\" and you can have more with an additonal fee. The TV channel selection was limited and kind of in an odd sequence. They have groups of six elevators each to service the different sections of floors, and they were quite speedy. \n\nThe employees I encountered from valet, bell service, and front desk were all well-mannered and helpful.

The club plays DEAFENINGLY LOUD hiphop til 4 AM and the bass can not be drowned out with earplugs.  \n\nIt is a terrible location for a club, even people at Bally's have to suffer.

Upon arrival after a very long drive from Los Angeles, I was informed that I'd be getting 2 Queen beds instead (completely unnecessary) and that my booking merely expressed a preference with no guarantee. Bit of a bummer. Thankfully I was still given a non-smoking room on the 18th floor. \n\nWhen getting to my room, I noticed that it had been a while since the doors had been cleaned as there were dirty marks around the handle and card slot. Then inside the room itself on the carpet I saw that the TV stand/armoire that previously was in there was replaced with another - but there were still strange marks and stains around it. Where you'd think the TV would be in the armoire is actually where the fridge is as the TV was on the side to the right making its location on the wall only visible to one of the beds. \n\nWhen I went into the bathroom I saw that whoever was in there previously cleaning missed a rather large tuft of hair on the floor, and I know it definitely wasn't mine as I have fine, blonde hair and this was thick and dark. Kind of grossed me out as I began to doubt what else hadn't been cleaned. \n\nThere was a paper on the desk in the room that is supposed to have on there who the cleaning person was, but no name was written and I could tell it had been there for a while since whoever was previously staying in the room wrote some numbers on the back of it. That paper was never touched the entirety of my stay as Saturday after the cleaning crew came in I checked it again and, sure enough, the numbers were found on the back of it. \n\nWhen I took my shower Saturday morning I deliberately left some hair on the shower wall to test the cleaning crew, but upon coming back from walking the Strip all afternoon it was still there and they left the shower door open. The trash was also untouched. \n\nThe room was really cold, and the blankets/comforters on the bed itself wasn't really sufficient so I found myself having to up the temperature a few times. \n\nOne of the people next to us got room service Sunday morning at a rather early time, so that woke me up as the walls were a little thin and whoever delivered the room service itself knocked loudly on their door. \n\nWhen making a final check in the room to make sure my boyfriend and I didn't miss anything when packing we discovered that there was a random cashew on the floor under the extra bed, and on the one we slept on the box spring covering looked dirty with black smudges on it. \n\nI had been looking forward to using the tub in the room, as I don't have a tub back at home, but it was really shallow (pictures made it look deeper) and even though I'm only 5'4\" I knew there was no way I'd fit comfortably - plus I doubted how clean it was after everything else.\n\nThe casino itself is so smoky, so if you have asthma or are sensitive to cigarette smoke like I am I suggest walking fast through those areas because it's quite gross. \n\nBeware using the ATM on the casino floor as well. It'll give you a prompt that there's the fee of $5.99 or whatever (to be expected), however on my bank statement I saw an ADDITIONAL charge of $2.50 which I wasn't informed of and thought that was pretty shitty. \n\nIf you drive there and park your car in valet, there is NO option to call earlier the day you're leaving to say something like \"please have my car (number on valet ticket) ready at 10:00.\" You just have to get down there and wait, which can take forever. I waited about 30 minutes for my car. Same goes for needing a cab. You have to wait in a long line outside off to the left instead. \n\nI did like how I could check in/check out electronically and skipping the potential lines, so that was nice at least. \n\nWould I stay there again? Maybe. The location is convenient in the middle of the Strip and across from the Bellagio fountain.

I filed a report with their security office, it was turned over to their Risk Management Company and we found out today our claim was DENIED.  They said they asked the hotel staff if they stole the stuff...Do you really think your staff is going to say \"Yes?\"  Now, they're saying the burden of proof is on us.  Uh, apparently they don't understand how burden of proof actually works.  I proved that my stuff was stolen when I filled out the report - unless you have cameras showing me packing my backpack out of the hotel, I've proved my case.  You pay a TON of money for a room thinking that you and your stuff is secure but apparently this hotel doesn't care about you, your stuff or your security.

I had transfered a few items from my purse into a smaller purse so my license and credit card were not taken, but the carry on, oversized leather purse and other miscellaneous items were taken. We contacted the hotel security that evening and had a pending report with them. Within a few weeks a was in touch with the hotels' insurance adjuster. I had to stay in touch with this person several times after that to see what had come of my claim.3 months after the theft i was told The Paris Hotel & Casino was not at fault of any wrong doing and my claim was denied. This was after they \"received\" a report from housekeeping saying that the housekeeping staff knew nothing about this theft. I tried calling the hotel several times to talk to a manager to see what else they could do for me and nothing. I got the run-around and I also got a hotel manager who said he couldn't help and he was too busy to take care of this. I lost $600 that day. For some, it may not be much money, but for me it was money i wasn't expecting to spend on a new carry on for the next mornings' flight and replacing a $300 purse.

Although it is getting old, it still has a cool vibe with the whole Paris theme. The casino is pretty small but then again, it doesn't take too long to get anywhere. \nCheck-in: I arrived early for conference and was told my room was not available. I could check in online at 11:00am for $20. I did but wasn't called until 11:40am to pick up my key. However, my friend arrived at 11:15 and was given a room without having to pay $20. This does not seem fair. I had left my bags with the bellman. As I was heading upstairs, I called them to deliver my luggage and it arrived right as I got to the room.\nRoom: I got a premium room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I like the fact that the room elevators were not that far from the main casino entrance. There is only one wing so getting to your room was fairly quick. The room was a good size with a couch (not pullout). The TV was in an awkward position hanging on the wall instead of in the Cabinet that was right next to it. The bathroom was very plain. Shower pressure was kind of poor. Bathroom amenities were basic. The closet was in between the bathroom and across from a desk. It was awkward because when you open the closet doors it blocked your entrance into the bathroom. The bed was of average comfort level. Wifi offered with the resort fee was on the slow side.\nAmenities: I utilized the spa (see my review) and workout facility. The workout room is located in the spa and is open at 6am. Kind of wished I could have gotten in earlier. But there are decent amounts of free weights and workout things. The spa was also decent. The workout and spa facility are part of the resort fee.

The staff member who checked us in wasn't exactly friendly, apathetic I guess is the right word. He checked us in quickly and wasn't pushy about a room upgrade, which I appreciate. Our room was on the 5th floor but to our surprise it was a large corner room with two windows. We even had a view of the Bellagio fountains from our room. The room was clean and came with a mini-fridge which is awesome for keeping snacks and drinks cold. The bed was comfy and the tv had a nice selection of channels. The hotel is right in the middle of the strip and we liked the convenient location. We ate at the buffet for breakfast before our flight back to San Antonio and it was delicious.

According to the front counter I was paying for a view of their swimming pool and eiffel tower. I was then told that I would have to pay another $44 per night for the view I wanted. I agreed to even that and so I walked all the way down with my bad knees and there was a different story.  \n\nEdith, Francisco and Mike at the front desk \"knowing lied to me and made me go back and forth 3 times to different rooms promising me a better view each time. I came to the conclusion that they were just screwing around with me since the only other alternative was that they didn't know their property very well. Bad attitude and unprofessional customer service from Mike was the reason that I am putting down this bitter review. Had it not been for Mike I might have not taken the time to write down this account of my \"BAD\" experience with this Hotel.\n\nNow Since they managed to get me angry, here is more on the experience that I would have not mentioned otherwise.\n\nThere was no coffee machine in my room and according to the housekeeping my premier room doesn't come with one...???  A first for me. So then I am left with 2 options either order a Liter of coffee for $12 plus extras, and have it delivered to my room, drink a cup and waste the rest  or walk all the way downstairs in my Pj's and get in line with other cranky people and  buy some. People need coffee when they wake up...... Unacceptable. I have never been to a hotel that doesn't have coffee in the room. A first for me. Maybe that is a Vegas thing. I don't know. I would have not mentioned this if it weren't for how I was treated by Mike.\n\nThere were unsafe dangling electrical wires and extension chords hanging loose in the room. I am pretty sure that its against the fire code to have that. I posted pictures and I hope somebody does take care of it before there is a fire. Toddlers can easily access these and wrap those around their necks and get entangled, electric shock or choke.  Please fix this management? Las Vegas Fire Dept? Whatever the code enforcement agency in Nevada is?\n\nTotally Contradicting to the room description, the carpets in the room were ugly stained worn out and dirty. I have posted a picture to refer to.\n\nAlso another very funny thing was that all the soap provided was smelling very feminine like flowers. Hello....? Men have to shower too. \nMost men don't like to walk out of the shower smelling like a bouquet of feminine flowers lol.. \nStupid people. Choose neutral fragrances that both men and women can use. \n\nWifi is only free for 2 devices. the third device is about $15.00 / day. Thats crazy. Again that might just be a vegas thing I don't know. \n\nI had never been to a motel before this. \n\nNow the thing to see is if this review gets any attention and what they care a damn to do something about atleast the loose electrical chords and Mike's ugly attitude.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I'm not going back to this place again."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "1", "name": "Carlos", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-28", "review": "The Paris Hotel and Casino is now the best representation of the Parisian neighborhood of Belleville, including the grime, dirt and the old prostitutes dressed like Britney Spears.

When I made my reservation I requested to add a note that I would be checking in late as I was expecting to arrive after midnight. When we checked in at 2:30am we were informed that because it was so late, they would have to give my husband and I a room with 2 queens instead of a king (which we were ok with, we were tired from travelling and just wanted to get into our room). The overall check-in process was quick with no issues and the person at the front desk was very pleasant. We got a room on the 15th floor, and as I opened the door I was startled with a large moth flying right to my face. Surprised, I stepped back and my husband proceeded into the room. As he turned on light above the doorway, 2 more large moths started flying in the room. We immediately knew we wanted another room, so I went to turn on the light on the desk to use the phone to call the front desk, and another 2 large moths were sitting on the lampshade! When I called the front desk to let them know there were moths in the room, the first response I received was, \"Ok, I can send housekeeping up there to get rid of them for you.\" SERIOUSLY?! I informed her that I did not want that, I wanted a completely new room. She proceeded to find me another room on the 5th floor and transferred our keys, but then said \"I can't guarantee that there won't be moths in that room either, because of the season, guests have been leaving their windows open.\" As I was talking with the front desk, my husband was checking around the room and found more moths in between the window curtains. We immediately went to our new room on the 5th floor, and thankfully it was moth free.\n\nWe had a Deluxe room, and it appeared pretty dated but the beds were comfortable. There were not many available outlets in the room, and the ones that were available seemed loose. The shower had strong pressure to our liking, but did not drain quickly and I was always standing in ankle deep water by the end of my shower (and I didn't even take long showers). The water also leaked onto the floor when we showered, so we always had to put extra towels down. Our room was cleaned daily, towels & water bottled replaced.

The main reason for this hotel given such low ratings is that it feels like everything is old and not maintained that well. upon arriving to my room, the AC did not work. they sent someone up right away to fix it. The maintenance guy fixed it and also put in a air filter since apparently it was missing, The room while overall clean, you could tell the wear in the carpet, chipped furniture, peeling paint in the ceiling. the sofa had unidentified white marks on it, which required a call to housekeeping for some white flat sheets to cover it to sit on. The bed while clean was sagging on both side which kept me sleeping dead center even if i didnt want to the one thing positive about this hotel was almost all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room i had was a monaco suite. So in conclusion for the right price its not overall bad, just dont expect high luxury."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "3", "name": "Elena", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-11-14", "review": "We were in Vegas for the Marine Corps Ball but we didn't have a room for the prior night so we thought we'd stay in Monte Carlo since we were already there.

Our last visit to Sin City was over 8 years ago and we knew a lot had changed since then.  If we were to head to Vegas we knew we wanted to do it right and have the steak dinner, the shows and the entire Vegas package.  Our last visit we stayed at the Venetian (which I loved) and although super nice it came with a price and we were unable to afford the amenities of the shows and everything else that Vegas has to offer.  After scouring the web and reading a ton of reviews we settled on the Monte Carlo for this trip.\n\nThe Monte Carlo is an older hotel but still carries itself with great luxury.  The hotel is still modern in its design and really does feel as upscale as many of the newer places in my opinion.  They have a number of restaurants on the premises and although most reviews I read said to stay away we found a great steakhouse and coffee shop that were fantastic.  Upon check-in we found that the room choice we had made were limited in availability and thus we ended up on the 7th floor which really hindered the view of the strip.  I was fine with this as we really weren't planning on spending much time in the room themselves although higher is definitely the way to go.  The room was spacious and nicely furnished, the water pressure was great in the shower (the tub unfortunately had a slow drain that wouldn't keep the water).  The one downfall to the room is the fact that the Monte Carlo only currently offers a wired internet connection in the rooms (our didn't work) and WiFi is only in the 1st two floors (casino and spa/pool areas).  It was unfortunately colder and quite windy during our visit so the Pool was never even an option on this visit.\n\nDespite having a long line at check-in, the process was smooth and seamless and we got through it in just a few minutes.  The express checkout is nice and can be done in numerous way as well including through the TV, the kiosks downstairs, via text message, calling a automated number on your room phone or filling out a card and leaving it at the desk downstairs.  \n\nThe Monte Carlos also houses a number of stores throughout as well as being the current home of The Blue Man Group show.  The also house the Minus 5 Bar, Ignite Bar and upscale eateries such as Andre's and Brand Steakhouse.  They offer Valet parking in front or self parking in a structure to the rear between Frank Sinatra and Las Vegas Blvd (although it was a bit hard to find unless you know where it is.\n\nFor what we got and the time we spent here, I feel that the Monte Carlo was a great value and a definite good stay.  The casino I found a bit lacking overall compared to some of the other nearby hotels but being as I am not a big gambler this was not much of an issue.  I would definitely stay here again for future visits."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "1", "name": "Ark", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-11-21", "review": "Beware of the flyer that the cleaning staff leave in your room called Pizza Bella - don't order from them - expensive and tasteless food.

However, my most recent trip in October 2014 was a huge, huge disappointment. \n\nI stayed in a Petite King room in the West Wing. There is no better way to describe the room than \"petite\" and borderline claustrophobic. The room is tiny, poorly lit, and has one window that does not open........  There isn't even a separate door to the bathroom/shower! As soon as you walk in, the bathroom is to the left right next to a shower and sink. The walls are also kinda thin- I could hear my neighbors' bathrooms flush. \n\nThere is also no mini fridge or coffee maker.. I thought these simple \"luxuries\" were standard nowadays. \n\nOne of the MOST annoying things about the room was its location. The hallways are ridiculously long (and I'm not even trying to sound lazy; they are just LONG. It takes at least 3-4 minutes walking at a decent pace to get down from one end to the elevator). They are also a bit eerie. \n\nOne \"good\" thing about the West Wing is the cardio room on the 4th floor. It's free and while it's tiny and sauna-like, it is better than nothing considering MGM charges guests $10 to access the actual hotel gym.\n\nWhat a disappointment, MGM. Not staying here again.

For that reason, it's admittedly a little unfair to downgrade the MGM Grand for opening near the beginning of The Strip's modernization.\n\nWith that said though, as you're deciding where to stay, the comparison has to be current day against current day, and the MGM Grand is one of my least favorite hotels on The Strip.  The walls in the rooms seemed paper thin, the room itself felt dark and uninviting, and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale.

Since I thought it'd be convenient to stay at MGM, I also booked a room - king size, non smoking. The prices for two nights were $149 (Friday night), $179 for Saturday night. They charged me $166. When I got there, I was told the room wasn't available. If I wanted, I got \"the option\" to upgrade (which I'd have to pay for). I got slightly upset, although I never raised my voice. \n\nI asked why I'm being charged $166 for something I'm not getting and why I was forced to pay for something I don't want? The manager came over and immediately said \"She's just doing her job!\" No s**t Sherlock! I'm not upset at the receptionist, I'm upset at the situation. Not fair to be charging customer for something he/she's not getting. On top of that, they place a pending charge on your CC (for me, it was $500 pending charge). \n\nSo they offered comp buffet and $50 off drinks. This is great for someone who eats at buffets and drinks, but I'm not a drinker and I don't eat at buffets, but when I said it to the manager, she said \"well, that's your only option.\" In regards to rooms, they are spacious, clean. The TV was working occasionally, the bathrooms were nicely remodeled. I must say the concert was fabulous!\n\nWhen I was checking out, I don't know what I was expecting, but I got \"how do you wish to pay for your bill\" question. This kind of floored me. So the rooms were $328 total minus the $166 charge (this would be around $162 total)+ the upgrade fee. You are already placing $500 charge on my CC, I guess I'm expecting you to say what you are going to give back to me. \n\nAnyway, long story short, the 2 nights cost me total $502. They charge you for upgrade you didn't want, they also charge your for something called \"remodeled room\", \"remodeled room tax\" (these charges are for every day you are staying) on top of your regular resort fee. I'm assuming that is normal, but quite frankly....for $250/night - it is NOT worth it."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Na", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-12-9", "review": "I stay at Mgm grand on Nov 30 - Dec 4 ,2014.Our room is Stay Well grand queen.We like Vitamin C infused shower and Air Purification in our room.Bed is very comfy."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Melissa", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-12-10", "review": "Stunning!

We got a comped room via \"MyVegas\" and they put us in a smoking room in the West Wing - as it was \"all they had left.\" Immediately walking up to the West Wing I realized, Wow they put us in a DUMP because it was free! You can smell the cigarette and weed from downstairs and in the elevators... granted I don't really care about either smell but when its that obnoxious... yuck. Our room was 3-505... practically the LAST room at the end of the hallway. The hallway carpet was stained and sticky... the room literally smelled and looked like shit. I mean these rooms are supposedly \"remodeled\" but it really looks like they just gave it a makeover but the ugly shitty old rooms are still under there, I would've rather slept in my car! Also note that the other guests they put in this wing are pretty much the loud, rachet, ghetto degenerates. \n\nThankfully - we had to go out so we just dropped off our stuff and left. However, when we came back, we went straight to the front desk to try to get an upgrade. THANK THE LORD FOR SOPHIA A. Sophia saved our trip.... I told her the situation, and she even laughed a bit when she found out we were in the West Wing. Apparently its KNOWN to the employees that its a shitty space. Anyways, she did some digging, talked to her manager, and was able to upgrade us to a room in the remodeled Grand Tower, AND on the 17th floor with amazing views of the strip!!! Sophia, you are a godsend! (and it was only her first month at the front desk!!)\n\nCASINO: Special shout out to blackjack dealers Alex and Jojo, and pit manager Kris. You guys made our night!!! We came back from the club and decided to hit the slots and tables, so from 6:30am to lord knows when, we were entertained by this lovely group of dealers/managers. We gambled enough to get our 2nd night comped, which truly made this a fantastic trip! \n\nVALET: I can't count how many attendants are running around constantly LOL but for as many staff as they have, its about a 20-30 minutes wait for your car. We lost our ticket but thankfully they were able to find the car and were super nice about it. The attendants could be a little friendlier... but I get it, when you're making 5s and 10s all day, its hard to be nice to everyone. \n\nRESTAURANTS: The District offers a large selection of restaurants, and food court. We went to Avenue Cafe (breakfast,) PUB (lunch/dinner) and TAP (sports bar.) The food is ok, the prices are high as you should expect them to be for 1) its vegas and 2) its inside a hotel, but overall the convenience of not having to walk or cab anywhere to get some grub is worth it. You may find that all the restaurants look empty, don't let that deter you from trying it out! That happened to us at the PUB, we almost turned around because it was empty but it was the best burger and best fries ever!!!

The hotel is simply stunning. It smells clean, the details are lovely, and if you book at the right times you can get an amazing rate. We paid $100 a night during the middle of the week! They held our luggage until check in time, and the process in doing so was easy and professional. We were checked in promptly, and the worker helping us said our rate was simply amazing. Though, my only complaint was that the room we booked online looked modern and upgraded. He informed us that the room they'd be giving us would not be. I'm assuming because of the low rate we paid. Therefore, he asked if we wanted to upgrade for $30 a night for their \"Stay Well Suite.\" We opted to do so and it was the best choice ever. We then pushed a little for something complimentary. Why not try the luck? After informing him that it was my birthday, he gave us free tickets to the MGM Buffet. He told me Happy Birthday and suggested some places for us to go on the Strip. The entire check-in experience was wonderful and we were treated like valued customers. I couldn't have asked for more.\n\nOn the way to our room, we were constantly surprised by just how gorgeous this hotel is. The casino leaves something to be desired, but it's a lot cleaner and less smoky than many of the ones we visited. It's on par with the Bellagio and Cesar's Palace, minus the beautiful sky scene. The Stay Well Suites have their own tower in the hotel, and a fountain in the middle that divides the sections. The fountain is breathtaking, as well as the elevator hallway. It's really something you just have to see for yourself. When we arrived to our room, we realized we had a semi-strip view. We didn't know we'd get a great view, so you can imagine the excitement there. The upgrade was completely worth it. The shower is infused with a Vitamin-C diffuser so that it streams through the water while you shower. There's a sound cube that plays sounds for you in case you have trouble sleeping. The bathroom had different lighting options for the mirror, which was a great touch. All the sheets and pillows are hypoallergenic, and extremely comfortable. The room felt clean and crisp, and smelled fantastic when we arrived.\n\nWe ate at the MGM buffet, and it was a decent little spot to catch a quick bite. A bit pricey for those who pay to eat, though. The service was good, and afterwards, we headed to concierge to find out about our Cirque Du Soleil show in the hotel. We had questions about when the show started, and the staff working were amazing when it came to answering our questions and offering suggestions on where to eat and places to go. They treated us like extremely valued guests, and I was genuinely surprised at how kind all of the staff are. We saw Ka in the MGM Theater, and I highly suggest this show. We weren't staying on a peak night, so the theater was about half full and we moved a little closer to be nearer to the action. It was absolutely wonderful. I was worried from reviews that it wouldn't be as thrilling as higher-ticket shows such as \"O\", but it left both my girlfriend and I feeling really satisfied with our choice.\n\nThe hotel is the largest on the strip, so sometimes getting from place to place can be quite a hike. We took the LV monorail system quite a lot, and it was a bit of a walk to get there from our Wing of the hotel. The pool area is also a fair bit away, so keep that in mind while booking. It is definitely worth the walk, however. The pool at the MGM was actually the reason we chose this hotel over several others. The lazy river is amazing and includes a waterfall area that we thought was just beautiful. Within the lazy river, there are areas that are quite fun, such as a wall of water that beats down on you like heavy rain. Details like this make this pool area top notch compared to a lot of other hotels on the strip. There are other pools you can visit, though some of them were closed during certain hours. They opened them up eventually, and you could escape to these low populated areas when the others got a little too busy. There are lifeguards on duty and located sporadically around the pool area, so if you have kids, they're likely to be safe and well looked after. Even during week days, the pool was booming with action. I assume during weekends and peak periods it would be extremely busy and crowded. However, it's simply too great of an amenity to miss out on. \n\nChecking out was also a breeze. We received the same wonderful service as we did arriving. The hotel once again held our baggage while we walked around the Strip for a few more hours. There was fruit infused water located in the lobby, as it was a high heat day. It was delicious and the kind of gesture we got used to staying here. The workers simply know how to treat their customers.

So when we booked via my Gold status on the MLife site, I even called in to make sure they were nearby or connected.  When we arrived, the line for the Gold+ level members only had 1 person while the regular line was really long.  The request was lost (go figures) so our kind receptionist tried her best to find rooms closer together.  But after 30 minutes (and by that time the regular line already cleared out :-( ), she had to downgrade one of my rooms to make it work.  She even mentioned that she had to deal with many very irate people pissed that Hakkasan was closed but nobody let them know when they booked.  I'm not a clubber but who's running the MGM ship? That grueling check-in gave a bad omen on the stay already...\n\nSo our rooms smelled like light smoke but we were so tired from check-in, we didn't want to go through that ordeal again.  Let me list what went sideways instead of writing it out.\n1) Our bathroom light was broken.  We called but it never got fixed\n2) Our Shower temperature handle was broken.  It either got super hot or cold.  Never got fixed\n3) On our second night, my wife wanted to have a bubble bath.  Black water came out of the tub spout.  I had a black-humor laugh at my wife's expense. \n4) Asked for housekeeping to spray the room to clean out the smoke smell.  Since they didn't do #1 or #2, just a guess they didn't do this as well.  They told me to call sooner if we smell smoke to catch smokers in the act in the hallway.  It felt like my old days playing Bad-Cop RA.  I don't want to be a snitch to get a smoke-free room!\n\nAlso, Avoid the 4th floor.  You're at the roof level and its a little awkward greeting workmen through your window in the morning in your nighties.

However, I think every hotel has this additional fee per night.  I personally liked this area of the Strip more because it was closer to the airport and was much less dense with people.  MGM also has a monorail station.  I recommend getting a 3-day monorail pass and planning accordingly.\n\nThe layout of the hotel is a bit annoying though.  We were there for a week and still had trouble finding our way around the casino.  It can be a SLOW walk to go through the casino from the elevators to the west entrance, and the bars and restaurants are at the opposite end.  I guess that's the point though. We did not go to gamble, and it would have been better to stay closer to the west entrance.

The room was cute and stylish, bed was comfortable. The automatic drapes and floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch. The sink however would fill up very quickly and drain extremely slow. Our strip view that we paid extra for was covered by a Donnie and Marie banner outside. We also paid extra for an early check in, and was told we would be contacted once the room was ready at noon. By 2:00 we still had not heard anything so I called and sure enough it had been ready the whole time.\n\nMy biggest concern and complaint is the valet service.  We parked our car valet on Sunday and picked it up Wednesday, so who knows what could have happened in between.  When we picked it up we immediately noticed our gas tank was 1/4 tank lower then when we left it, but decided we couldn't really do much about it. Later down the road I noticed a starbucks napkin next to the seat. We have not been to starbucks in this car, its brand new. And finally and most damaging when we stopped for gas 2 hours down the road we noticed a huge deep scrape on the back passenger wheel and a large chunk out of the tire. I have attempted to contact the hotel regarding this and have not received any response. \n\nThe elevators are HORRIBLE, dirty, rickety, some feel very unsafe. The casino was just okay, nothing special, old. Margaritaville was okay, cool decor, lots to look at, food was nothing special but good, same with the drinks. The animal habitat was nice to check out, although from other reviews I expected more. \n\nWe had to pay $20/day resort fee which is supposed to cover the gym and wifi. Our wifi did not work at all. We also noticed a sign in the room saying wifi was $13.99/day. Kinda pissed at that!!\n\nThe best & worst part of the whole place is the pool. We had lots of fun the two days we spent at the pool. The drinks are strong and the music is fun. The pool food was far better then any of the restaurants at the Flamingo! That being said, shame on Flamingo for allowing just anyone into this pool. We had to stand in line for an hour before the pool even opened just to get a lounge chair. This pool is not just for hotel guests witch is appalling to me! Anyone can pay to get in. In fact they didn't even check our room keys or IDs (21+) upon entering. We could have been anyone off the street. \n\nWatch out for the various booths around the hotel with people offering you a free show and buffet. It sounded like a great deal and the people were nice, so we signed up. When we went to our free buffet, only then did we find out we were stuck in a Wyndham timeshare scam for 5 hours!!! \n\nWe saw Vinny Favorito at the Flamingo. The show was great! We laughed the whole time. Hes not for everyone though, they do warn you when you buy the tickets. He performs in Bugsy's Cabaret, its almost disgusting in there. They really need to update that room. We were seated on very small chairs placed extremely close together. Chairs and carpet looks VERY dirty, we almost walked out before the show started due to the state of the room. Glad we stayed because Vinny was hilarious. \n\nWe also ate at the Paradise Garden buffet during our stay. It was truly gross. Everything I tried tasted was nasty. Oversalted, stale, real lack of any kind of quality. WAY over priced for what you get to choose from. No dessert bar at all! Very outdated seating & decor. In fact I had the worst stomach ache later that night. Pretty positive it was the buffet food.\n\nAll in all we would stay here again if the price was right. Our room and the pool was the best part, and thats what we would come back for. I would take our dining elsewhere. They really need to update the rest of the hotel to match the new style of the rooms.

Wanted to take a shower after the flight and long check in prior to our dinner reservations, did not check for towels first, never had too before in any other hotel I stayed at, got into the shower and waited for hot water...waited for warm water, gave up and waited for luke warm water...semi tepid water...anything....water continued to be freezing cold after 25 mins of running it.\n\nI got out of the cold shower and noticed that there were no towels...like not even one...just a wash cloth.  Now I'm not a small girl...no way that wa going to cut it.  Had to get dressed while still totally wet.\n\nDripping wet and cold I was still in a fairly jovial mood..I was in Vegas after all! nothing was going to get me down!!  Unfortunately that all changed when I attempted to speak to someone about the cold water.\nI spoke with Teresa who was supposed to be a manager, she was snippy and overtly rude and decidely uncaring about the situation.  Took me three more phone calls to get them to deal with the problem.\n\nWaited 20 mins, housekeeping finally arrived with towels-they seemed surprised that we would think that towels came with the room (?)\nWaited for the maintenance person who ran the water for another 20mins and then declared that no hot water was to be had in this room.\n\nWe called the front desk again, they were very rude, told us that we would either need to move to the smoking room on the top floor or the wheelchair accessible room.  We choose that top floor as they said that it was an upgrade.\n\nI was mad that we would have to give up the King room we booked for a double queen....but beyond that they made the whole prcess of changing rooms such a pain, my good mood was gone at this point!!\n\nWe were escorted by security to get our things, then back down to the front desk to collect our new room key...it was nuts and totally unessessary.  They were unapologietic about the whole matter...we just wanted our room!!\n\n3) We got to the new room and immediately I noticed that it had not been cleaned in some time, the light switches were flithy, the hair dryer did not work, there was a panty liner behind the bed (gross) along with an assortment of water bottle caps and huge dust bunnies.  The view was good as it was of the wheel, however there was not much else about the room that was positive.\n\nAnd once again there were no towels!!!!\n\nI set off on a mission to find a cleaner and more importantly a cleaning cart with supplies.  I spoke to the maid on the floor and explained what I found in our room, shesimply shrugged her shoulders and said that I could call the front desk.  Noting my terrible experience with them already, I decided to not call and take matters into my own hands.  I proceeded to help myslef to the fresh towels on the cart, and some cleaning supplies....YES ladies and gentlemen...I cleaned our friggin' room!!!!!  And let me say that I do take some pride in saying that I did a phemonimal job of it!!!!  They should hire me to train their housekeeping staff.\n\n4) We got up early the next day and did not return to our room until almost 6:30pm to shower and change for our evening out.....I could not believe it...no housekeeping staff had bothered to turn up!!!  no clean towels for our showers (we left the days previous towles in the bathtub as is customary to request fresh towels) Needless to say I set out on a mission again to find a cleaning cart.  Thankfully I found someone at teh end of the hall, I advised them that our room had not been cleaned...no fresh towels...and you guessed it...she didn't care.\nI took some towels off her cart, enough for the next two days...and stomped off.\n\n5) told the manager later at the front desk-someone named Josh-he apologized and comped us a free breakfast-thanks but doesnt make up for all the work cleaning I did...lol\n\n6) Be ready to be totally harrassed by a ton of people posing to be Flamigo hotel staff wanting to give you a \"free gift\" they are trying to sell time shares and sign you up for a 2+ hour presentation-THEY WILL NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE EVEN WHEN TOLD NO!"}, {"type": "Negative Deceptive", "stars": "2", "name": "Jeff", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-11-23", "review": "When gangster Bugsy Siegel opened The Flamingo in 1946 he envisioned a hotel with luxurious rooms, the best liquor and restaurants, a spa, and top rate entertainment at reasonable prices in the best building that money could buy. If Siegel could see what this hotel has degraded to he would probably beg you to shoot him in the face again. Thank god we only had to stay here for one night.\n\nImagine a Super 8 or Motel 6 stacked twenty-eight times high with Donny and Marie's faces spray-painted on it. Now put the slowest elevators in the history of vertical transport inside the building and you'll start to get a clear picture of what this hotel is like. By slow, I mean it takes forever for an elevator to arrive. If I wasn't on the tenth floor I would have taken the stairs every time.\n\nThe current incarnation of The Flamingo isn't 70 years old but if you saw the interior of our room you would think it was. If someone had told me that the building hadn't been renovated in decades I would have believed it. The vanity in the bathroom looked as though someone had scraped a wood planer across the front of it. The paint was also peeling off the bathroom ceiling and a floor tile was loose. The room had no fridge or microwave either. The best part of the whole experience was the lack of free wifi in the hotel. We walked through every major hotel and resort on the strip and every single one offers free wifi. The only way you get wifi for free here is if you pay a $25 resort fee. So it's not really free is it?\n\nThe check-in process was a long, frustrating cattle call. It was like waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. After spending 20 minutes in line we were \"greeted\" by a rude, abrupt, and indifferent clerk. She seemed like she was just \"putting in her obligatory time\" at the desk in hopes of getting an executive position.\n\nThere was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign in the room so needless to say, housekeeping tried to enter the next morning. I don't know why they tried to come in at half-past ten because check-out is at 11:00. Why doesn't the housekeeping staff wait until you've checked out? It just seemed like they were trying to get us out of there sooner.\n\nThis place is a dump. The Flamingo is riding on the coat tails of its former glory. Every other major hotel on the strip has it beat with superior amenities and service. We should have stayed in one of those. Lesson learned for next time.\n\nThe only professional service we got was from the bell desk staff when we checked our bags.

I booked Flamingo using AirMiles and this may have influenced the room we got.  When I booked, I requested an early check in and a non smoking room.\n\nThe night before we checked in, I went to ask about the early check in.  I was told that early check in would result in a charge of $20-30 (I can't recall the exact amounts) depending if we wanted to check in before or after 12PM.  It wasn't worth paying extra so we went to check in at 4:30PM after their 4PM time.  Be prepared to line up.  The estimated time was about half an hour but at least they offered small bottled water.\n\nWe checked in and waited by the elevators.  The elevators are sloooooow and not just during check in (Waited at least 5 minutes at 10PM and 9AM).  There are 2 sets of elevators, with the one set saying it will go down only (there are 4 elevators and they are used by staff but they are faster than the other ones so I recommend going down from your room using these ones).  Some of the elevators like to rock and roll but don't worry, this seems to be normal.\n\nOur room, 10062, was the first one at the end of the hallway.  I wasn't sure how noisy it would be but luckily it wasn't too bad.  Being spoiled by HGV stay, we didn't appreciate there was no mini fridge, no free wifi anywhere in the hotel/casino, and an old room.  The bathoom vanity has paint peeling off, dresser and desk had knicks, and grout in bathtub.  I wasn't sure if we paid the resort fee as we did have to pay fee and taxes booking using AirMiles so I called to ask but we didn't.  I think the fee is only for wifi for one device/room which doesn't make sense.  \n\nThe worst issue was the loud hum when it was time to sleep.  It sounded like an engine and luckily I was able to fall asleep with this noise.  When I woke up, there was no hum.  We didn't want to bother lining up again to check out so we did so via the TV system for self check out.\n\nYes, the hotel room is only to sleep in but when I'm on vacation, I want to be comfortable and well rested.  Makes it difficult to do that when they don't offer the amenities to enjoy the stay.

Overall, very pleased with my stay!\n\nTip: If you arrive early but want to avoid the early check-in fee and long lines at 4pm - start the check in process and check your bags at the bell desk.  Definitely make it clear that you are NOT fully checking in and that you will get your keys at 4pm.  Double check that the charge is not applied.  Come back at 4pm and go straight to the \"keys & mail\" line.  You can then pick up your keys, call the bell desk from your room and have them sent directly to you!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "2", "name": "Roy", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-30", "review": "Never thought we need to pay to print boarding passes here been in most of the hotel elsewhere where the printing service is free.  hotel room looks ok.

At the time we ate we were told the meal was charged to the room, so we thought we were good to go. What a big suprize to find out we weren't.

Not our side, I'll tell you that. \n\nIt was like everywhere else was covered in shiny pretty lit-up glitter and fascinating lights and then you walk into the dust covered, faded eyesore that is the Flamingo and you're like I have to stay here?!. The check-in line was relatively quick, albeit it was Thanksgiving and most people were not traveling. It was also really cool how nonchalantly the check-in girl told me that they did not have the room we reserved 3 months ago, and they had no more non-smoking rooms left, but she would upgrade us to a bigger room with \"great view.\", oh and the list of fees on my reservation failed to include the insane deposit fees which cost more than my room! Like how do they even do the training for that? I just picture some cheapo slimeball like, here's what you want to do, you want to subtly tell them something that can ruin their vacation, but present the info to them with the tone of voice that says 'hey, its no big deal.' \n\n@#!@#!$@#!@^&%^% And the wifi isn't even easy to use and can only accommodate one person. And the resort fees are for nothing. You are paying for wifi and a gym that doesn't even seem to be anywhere in the entire resort.\n\nThe \"great view\" was of the lobby's roof and the pool that is shut down for the season. La di da. And this room was gross. And it was tiny. I had to clean my own toilet because their incompetent staff failed to do an adequate job. The toilet paper itself was held, not on a roll, but on a flamingo pen. WTF?!?!?! The bathroom isn't even big enough for two people to get ready, like helllooo Vegas? That is part of the fun and you're shitting on it. The shower curtain had super gross mold on it. EWWWW. \n\nThe pillow and sheets didn't even look like they had been changed. There were stains on every surface in the room. Sheets, pillows, tub, toilet, walls. Grossss. \n\nEverything in the room was unplugged when we got in, we had to plug all our own lights in in the dark using the flash lights on our phones. There definitely weren't outlets in the room. I had to plug my phone in on the other side like a freaking common peasant and then get up every time I needed to check something. Basically impossible when you've been having fun all night in Vegas. \n\nAnd their room service menu was insulting. I must have reread it like 17 times in the hopes that something appetizing would appear. It was a joke. \n\nAnd their food court -OH MY GOD - if I never see another Johnny Rockets burger again it will be too soon. They only had Johnny Rockets, some not Panda Express type place, a pizza place that doesn't even serve Pizza all the time and the strips most okayest wrap place, I think that place had about a million things on its menu, but I don't have time to read a novel when I'm hungover so I just stuck with the basics. The food was all awful. It was like two parts grease for all parts anything else. Eating it was a chore and I will tell you the greasy BS theyre passing off as food won every time because I could not finish any of it.

It's not the tallest or the biggest building, but it's probably the oldest. All signs lead to flamingo. The outside is kinda weird looking with a really old Donny and Marie signage. Being in the middle of ceaser's, the linq and Cromwell: all of which are new or really luxurious make flamingo look like a dump.\n\nInternal:2/5\nCasino floor not much better. The check-In area looks fine, but the garage looks HORRIBLE: and there's never enough parking. The casino floor has this horrible orange carpeting. The floors themselves aren't much better. The elevators are missing floor labels AND buttons! WHAT? The first habitat elevator on the left didn't have a button to get to the 17th floor, so we had to wait for another elevator...\n\n\nService: 3/5\n- It was great when I needed it, but the fact that I had to need it was a problem. First, housekeeping didn't clean our room so we had to request it at 10pm when we got back. Of course that ment we have to find something to do during that time.\n- The wifi is horrible and the fact that we have to pay a resort fee for it is also a huge scam. \n-Uponcheck out I used $90 in comps to pay my room. I had like $20 bucks left and The guy just took the rest off, so the room was essentially entirely free. THANKS!\n\nRooms: 2/5 (Double bed high roller view deluxe...)\n-the toilet had a water problem and kept draining. Super loud and the water smelled like sewer water. Ugh.\n-Plasma screen TV, fully functioning and quiet heater. \n-the room was FREEZING when the heater wasn't on and they turned it off during cleaning so we always came back to a freezing room.\n-not enough outlets: we had to unplug some of their stuff so we could charge our things.\n-horrible cellphone reception for ATT and Sprint\n- the first time I stayed here the rooms looked much better with funky pink shag carpeting and accents on the beds. They were unique and very flamingo. This time we had bare essentials.\n- Standard amenities. Nothing here blew my mind, but nothing was subpar either. \n-NOT enough lighting! NO NO NO. Biggest complain is that it was REALLY dark. The curtains do a great job of blocking everything out through. Oversleeping is easy.\n\nFood: 3.5/5\n- there's a small cafe by the elevator that serves the greasiest pizza known to man. The cheese falls right off the pizza: basically liquid.\n- the food court is decent. Johnny Rockets is nice and has good service at a decent price. Didn't do buffet.\n- Everything is 24/7: best part.\n\nCasino Floor: 2/5\n-nothing was hitting and the wait staff was pretty rude.\n- Margaritaville in fact did not have the $5 advertised craps or blackjack tables. And yes, we were there on weekdays.\n- cages are pretty efficient. Though they feel the need to ID people to cash out if they look young... This is a first for me.\n-best bet is to just play next door at Cromwell. Everything there is new and clean and professional with similar table minimums. \n\nOverall not a good trip by any means.

The room I stayed in was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever slept in. That just didn't make up for what is lacked in other areas to me. I would actually suggest this hotel for a couple looking for some romantic time. I was with friends and just couldn't enjoy all of the amenities the room had to offer. Again, not their fault, but you should know if you are looking for a wild girls weekend. \n\nCheck in and out was fast. The line for cabs was always moving steady and well organized. I ordered room service once and they were fast and VERY friendly. All of the employees were friendly (except casino). I'll get to that.\n\nYou could get lost for days in here. Most staff can help you but I ran across a few that were just as confused as I was. I would recommend spending a day just exploring the different areas within the hotel (if you have time to kill).\n\nThe pool was nice. I liked the scene. No real @%#h0l&es hanging out here. Drinks are crazy expensive (but average for Vegas prices). The server we had was excellent! She took great care of us and kept the glasses of ice coming. I wish I could remember her name. She was adorable! \n\nI also appreciate that the staff immediately moves belongings from unattended chairs. Don't attempt to save a chair at this place while you sleep upstairs. I went down about 10am and had no trouble getting a good spot. \n\nOnly half the pool is actually in the sun. It's the more crowded half. I was over heated after 20 minutes so I guess that can be a good thing. \n\nThe casino is where they lose me! Minimums on tables are pretty average. I was annoyed when I went down to play Pai Gow Poker one morning and I was the only person playing (8am) in an almost empty casino and the minimum was $25. Whatever. \n\nThe real kicker is drinks! I gambled for 4 straight hours before I ever saw a cocktail waitress at one point. The other wait times averaged anywhere from 10 minutes-2 hours. I would say average was an hour wait for a drink. Totally unacceptable. I was never offered water, etc. \n\nThe girls were sweet when they came by, but finding them was beyond ridiculous! Good luck purchasing a drink there too. Sky high prices which put me over the edge as I was dropping huge cash in casino and couldn't get a damn Pepsi! \n\nBasically, only go here if you are looking for a beautiful room and spending some real time in it.

This place is well named as Venice is a complex maze of hard to navigate streets and canals as well.  I never knew quite where I was in the hotel and it took a good ten minutes just to walk from our room to the casino floor.   Since their rooms are in towers, you have to take an elevator up to the hotel lobby, walk down a long hallway, take another elevator up to your floor and then walk down another couple hallways to your room.  Simple in theory, but every time I came up I saw people having to stop for directions....just to get to their room!   At least there is gorgeous decor to accompany you on your aimless lost wanderings around the halls of the Venetian. Gas lamps, gilded accessories, comfy chairs to rest your weary legs in...\n\nOur room was very nice however, with a comfy bed, suite layout with separate seating area and a shower AND large tub.  Our view was of a parking lot and a parking garage, but had some mountains in the background that were nice if you blocked out the lower view.

Ok, now that I have THAT out of the way, let me tell you how my time here went....\n\nFor starters, I few southwest, so I came in and out of the same terminal both times. The second time I was here, I noticed that they are building (or have built) another terminal.  Interesting.\n\nOn first impressions, I thought \"wow, this place is kind of small compared to other places I have been\" and totally not what I was expecting for Las Vegas. Phoenix's airport is 10 times bigger, cleaner and has a ton more restaurants' then this!  Even Detroit's new airport is bigger!  pfft.\n\nThere were some places to shop at, but the airport seemed to be overloaded with slot machines.  I've heard about this before, but still thought it was kind of cool to actually see in person.  I could even see them from the airplane once we pulled into the gate!  The downside?  Lack of seating while waiting for your gate!  I would have rather had a few more seats if you ask me, and for as busy at this place is, I would have liked some additional chairs!  So many people here!\n\nThey had a few places to eat in here, but again, I didn't see many places to sit. The terminal was long and skinny, and I didn't have enough time to wander and study the whole thing.  I love that I was able to get off and go right into the smoking lounge without having to buy a drink. It's literally right between gates C6 and C8.  Awesome!  Slot machines in there too!\n\nThe staff I interacted with were friendly, outgoing and what I would expect for Las Vegas. Not uptight, but not overly laid back either.  Definitely fun, that's for sure!  \n\nThis airport isn't bad, and serves it's purpose. Hey, I've seen some smaller crazier airports in my day, but really I wish they would step up their game a little bit.

All of this equates to the best people watching experience you will ever have. \n\nFinally, this airport has something that I've never seen in any other airport, slot machines.  So if the shopping and people watching isn't keeping you entertained, and you haven't already lost your life savings, you can pull up a seat and try your luck at some last minute winnings. \n\nIf you are flying into Las Vegas, our baggage claim area is huge and very efficient. You won't have to wait long for a bag. Ground Transportation is also pretty simple. The taxi line may look forever long but it's lightening quick.

We were surprised to see the rows of slot machines all over the airport. The restroom was clean. The walk to baggage claim was a bit long. When we got to baggage claim, we had to wait for an hour for our luggage due to a malfunction on the carousel. After we got our bags, we headed out to find a taxi. I did not expect to find over 100 people in line for a taxi, but the staff kept the line moving well. After 20 minutes we got a taxi to our hotel (Luxor, about $24 bucks trip).\n\nFlying out:\nWe found out we could take a bus to the airport (from in front of Tropicana hotel). We flew Southwest, so we stopped at the Terminal 1 stop. I was surprised by how large the check-in area was. It took us a little less than 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to the Southwest airlines check-in. There was no one in line, so checking our bags was very quick. I had my boarding pass on my phone and the scanners at check in were having a hard time reading it. One of the Southwest airline reps came over to help me scan it and after about 20 attempts it went through. I would say that this experience was the fastest bag check I've encountered. During security, we got routed through the pre-screen line, so security was a breeze. Once we got into the terminal, I was surprised to see how many people were there. It was difficult finding seating, so we sat in a couple empty chairs in a nearby area. There were tons of restaurants and fast food places and various little shops. Every space was taken up by a shop, restaurant, slot machines, or a charging station. This has to be the most dog friendly airport because I saw almost 10 dogs being led on leashes inside the terminal. There were no comfy chairs...at all, so we were terribly uncomfortable. A lot of people were sitting on the floor, and some were even laying on the floor (which looked disgustingly dirty). There were only a couple of power outlets in the airport and they were all full with people sitting on the floor next to them to use them.

The bartender acted all put upon that I--a customer--wanted a game that I wanted to watch on the tv! Imagine that! He was all snippy and acted like I was being super demanding about it.

It has slot machines in it which is completely badass. You get one last shot at some bug buck before you go and it does help pass the time while waiting for flights. Ok I am going to break this down now. \n\nSecurity:\nWe all have to take our shoes off and go through security. That can either be a very painful experience or it can be easy. Even though it is unpredictable I can say for all the times I have come here it has been easy. they have a system and they know how to move people through security quickly. the agents there really do not want to waste any time. They just wanna get people through and on their way. The only delays really come from people who are not prepared. \n\nRestaurants and shops:\nThis airport has plenty of restaurants and shops. They have the small little generic gift shops and they also have really nice high end type stores where you can get clothes, shoes and handbags. They have a good mix of fast food type places and sit down type places. Be aware that they charge airport prices though so get ready to pay more. \n\nNavigation:\nThis airport is really easy to navigate through. They have plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction. It is hard to get lost here. they have plenty of elevators, moving walkways, and escalators to help you get where you are going faster as well. Also getting out is easy. They have one area for people picking you up, another for taxis, and another for shuttles. It is very easy to get in and out. \n\nOverall this is a great airport.

All beautifully and exquisitely decorated. Theme is floral. First thing you notice when you come in are the huge red chandeliers right in the middle of the check in area. Amazing!!!\n\nThe main reason why I booked this hotel is because you get more for your money in the sense that the rooms are huge! Black and beige are the dominant colors in the room decoration. \n\nI love that you can turn the lights on and off with a click of a button. As well as closing the curtains and putting the privacy in your room. Great convenience.  And the best part, it's right next to your bed. So you don't have to hit your toes with everything around you trying to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The beds are oh so comfy!!! But the robes......OMG!!!!!! I need one in my life! The bathrooms are pretty much the size of a regular room in any other hotel.\n\nNow, the reason as to why I gave this hotel 4 stars and not 5.\nUpon arrival, we were told that the hotel holds $150 a NIGHT, we stayed 4 nights so that's $600. So go ready for that! This was our second time in Vegas and this is the first time I have ever heard of a hotel holding so much per night. Oh, aside from paying resort fees. Another reason why I gave it 4 stars, the pool area isn't as nice as other hotels. I prefer the one at the wynn, which is just a few steps away. And a plus is that if you stay at the encore, you can visit the pool at the wynn as much as you like! The casinos at the encore are super nice, but the Wynn casinos looked a little outdated to me. \n\nThe downside of staying at the south of the strip is that you have to do some major foot work to get to the good stuff on the strip. Bellagio fountains, Paris Eiffel Tower, etc. so be prepared to waste more on taxis than usual. Unless you rent a car. Which in my opinion isn't worth it if you're visiting the strip. Too much traffic. \n\nLast but not least, the restaurants in this hotel are extremely expensive! Even breakfast. It's over priced. We all know vegas is overpriced, but this hotel takes the cake! Now, the food at the restaurants was great Dont get me wrong, but definitely way too overpriced. \n\nWould I stay here again? Maybe not. Service was great, hotel was beautiful.

Heh It still lives up to it's 5 star elegance and is better than Bellagio in my opinion. But really, you can't compare Bellagio and Encore because they are two different resorts with different themes. Encore was chosen mainly because it is set far away from the rowdiness that is \"Sin City\" and into it's own niche in the northern part of the strip. The Encore is an all suite tower with an option to upgrade to the larger suites or with the panoramic view. Luckily for us we were upgraded to the panoramic view on the 56th floor for free because we my cousin knew one of the front desk clerks. \n\nAs you can tell through the details of the well appointed casino like the colorful butterflies on the mosaic floor and on the ceiling, his idea for the Encore/Wynn theme was \"Natural Beauty.\" It shows throughout the complex the big expensive windows overlooking the gardens and the warm colorful tones of the property and the many waterfalls outside of the property make you feel secluded from the rest of the strip. Aside from the hotel / casino, the clientele is very attractive and healthy compared to the ones who patron the low end hotels. \n\nStaff here are top notch and live up to the Wynn standard of service. I didn't get to try the pool because we were always in and out of the hotel. You are allowed to use the Wynn pool which is just a 5 minute walk from Encore. Outside of the complex, I wouldn't walk north at night because the neighborhood is shady and a lot of panhandlers and sketchy people populate north of Encore. If you're looking to save some money from Encore's fancy restaurants, there is a Denny's just outside of Encore and a food court in the Fashion Show Mall right across the street.   \n\nThe casino is not as smokey as the other casinos with it's strong ventilation systems and fancy scent they pump into the air system. I will admit I did win some money playing at Wynn because the slots at Encore are tight. They always send great deals when you gamble a few $$$ in their casino. Encore has swoon me over and I will definitely come back if I receive a good deal.

It had a deep soak tub but i found it a little short. I'm 5'10 and well it was a short fit, but still very relaxing. The towels were plentiful, thick and oversized which was nice. Although they were a bit rough. Also the bathrobes they provide were in kind of rough shape. One had a weird yellowish tinted stain on it and the terry fabric inside was as rough as the towels. \n\nOkay so outside of the room the entire resort is beautiful. We ate at \"The Buffett\" and I hate to say this but overall I was slightly disappointed.  The salad portion of the very long buffet was a big let down. The greens were wilted. The \"Red and white quinoa salad was nice. The macaroni salad just made me sad. Very bland and seemed to have been setting out a long time. The highlight was the blue cheese dressing.\nThe cheese and salami station is worth skipping, nothing impressive. \nThe turkey, and prime rib were very good. Especially the turkey.  Very tender and flavorful. \nI also tried the Chipotle bbq meatloaf which was yummy. The kobe beef burger were good. I thought they were a bit on the bland side.  The bbq pork bun and chicken pot stickers were both a big let down. The bun was really, really dry and the filling was almost nonexistent.  \nThe street tacos were really good as well. \nThey have a really nice desserts section my favorite by far was the blood orange Panna Cotta. \n\nWe also got to see the Show \"Showstoppers\" which is basically a musical mash-up of a few different famous Broadway shows including \"Chicago\" (All that Jazz, and Cell block Tango) the latter being my favorite performance of the show.  The also did a number from Cabearet (Money). Damn Yankees (The Game). \n Hello Dolly (Put on your Sunday clothes)  There were a few other song sung by the lead members inbetween the big numbers including \"Anything I can do\" Which is a really fun number the interaction between the two leads during this song is great. They really played well against each other. The finale was A Chorus Line..I know im forgetting several numbers and that's because they were very forgetable. The one thing that really sucked about the show was Steve Wynn's voice overs..They were completely unnecessary. His booming voice jus takes you right out if the moments of being at an old time Vegas show.\n\nOverall this was a great stay. The staff is not only very helpful and friendly but seem to actually enjoy their jobs.. We will definitely be staying here again..\n\nDid I mention the beds are AMAZING!!!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Susan", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-12-19", "review": "I have to hand it to the Encore.

This airport has four terminals, so depending on which airline you use, you could have a fab experience or a completely drab one. I checked in about an hour too early so I was able to explore a little bit between terminals. Terminal three is like a mix between a mall food court and a ghost town. There's a sbarro and a few security check points and some gift shops. Once you get through the checkpoint you walk through the gate area where nothing is open and there is a drink vending machine. All the restaurants are closed during the day and evening and the gift shops seem like they haven't been open in months. If you take the shuttle out to terminal four, its like you are at a completely different airport. \n\nTerminal four is more modern, new, and filled with restaurants made popular in Phoenix. There's a Lo-Lo;'s Chicken and Waffles there so if you missed the opportunity to stop at the actual restaurant in the city, definitely grab something here. There are also some cool shops and more people in this terminal. It's very clean and there are a lot of security and general staff personnel available to direct you. \n\nThere is a shuttle that stops every few minutes at the terminals so if you have the time, take the shuttle to explore the various locations at the airport. It's a great time killer if you are super early for your flight or have a long layover. \n\nOverall, this terminal is spacious, clean, has helpful staff, and it takes about 10-15 minutes to get through security.

Extremely efficient pick up/drop off areas with plenty of space for everyone\n\n\nTo expand on each thing that I really enjoy...\n\nTSA Process:\nI frequently travel with just one carry on item and it's generally a process. I'm a frequent flier so I know how to breeze through the lines, if the airport recognizes this and lets me.  By that I mean doesn't stick me in a super long line behind people with a ton of baggage (or kids). (Sorry but it's true!)  Sky Harbor seems to \"get\" this more than other airports and frequently sends me and other people who don't have many items into a smaller, more quickly moving line.  Perhaps I'm totally wrong about this and it's just luck but it's something I've noticed after flying out of PHX dozens fo times.  \n\nAwesome Restaurants:\nNormally airports suck at food- they'll try to have options but instead of offering great restaurants they give you shitty options.  (I'm not sure which I'd rather have- no options or shitty options... probably shitty options.) Sky Harbor has a lot of options that are not shitty- not at all!  For example, last year they put in a Matt's Big Breakfast- if you're not from Phx or haven't visited or lived there for a period of time you probably don't know about the gem downtown that is Matt's big breakfast.  It is an awesome breakfast spot with bacon that is almost a half of an inch thick.  YEAH.  There are awesome food places in Sky Harbor and I always try to get there early just to eat.  A funny tidbit.... last year I was flying on Thanksgiving day and ended up having my Thanksgiving dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen outside of the TSA checkpoint at Sky Harbor- haha!\n\nEasy Navigation: \n\nThis one is pretty straightforward so the point I'll focus on here is that they are a stop on the light rail that runs all across the Valley.  I have frequently used this system and have found it foolproof.  Rarely to I trust public transportation when trying to get somewhere with a tight timeframe but I absolutely trust the light rail system with the Sky Harbor drop off points.  \n\nPick Up/ Drop Off Areas:\n\nLong story short (I've already written a novel- about an AIRPORT - I'm crazy.) they have really easy pick up drop off areas that are heavily monitored for stalling and it makes it really easy to get space to get in or out of the airport quickly! \n\nIf you need to have a long layover this is the airport to have it in!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "John", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-12-31", "review": "Nice.

After waiting for what seemed to be forever for the receptionist to answer the call to report our findings, they finally answered then sent security up to our room. Again waiting for what seemed to be forever. The security came, we gave him the bed bug for evidence. By this time the bug was seeping blood from probably being flicked off the bed w/ his belly full of human blood. (We know it was a bed bug!) No report was filed because we could not verify that one of us had been bitten. However it seemed pretty obvious considering the blood coming from the bug. In any event we were told to simply get our clothing cleaned and send Luxor the bill. Security left. After thinking about this further we decided to go downstairs to report because we didn't want to send a bill in for the cleaning and them not having anything on record. We went downstairs, took forever to get the manager over. Basically they offered to take ALL our clothing and clean it themselves then 'ship' us the clothing. Seriously? by this time we had already loaded the luggage into our car. Now the car could possibly be infected? not to mention we would be w/out our clothing for like 2 wks. They refused to discount the room and they also seemed to be unconcerned about the incident. It was not taken seriously. Basically they were to shut the room down for the next customer and take our clothes and inspect the room for 'possible' infestation. They said the would call regarding their finding. The fact that we gave the bug to the security appeared to be irrelevant. The bug was the 'evidence' in our opinion. But that didn't mean much to them. \n\nBasically I don't feel they took the situation seriously.

Seven years ago, we stayed in the pyramid after a busy holiday season. We'd requested an early check-in after driving in from Los Angeles, and I thought that the smudges on the windows, the stale air and the light coating of grime could be attributed to the rush to get things ready earlier after what must've been a busy New Year's Eve crowd. However, arriving for a regular weekend in November that was not connected to a peak travel event, I'm not able to give them the benefit of the doubt this time.\n\nLuxor wouldn't have been our first choice, but because they had offered a fantastic rate and our activities were planned closer to that end of the strip, we felt we couldn't pass up the opportunity. We hadn't been through the doors in seven years, but the lobby looked pretty much the same. Not that a hotel has to constantly redecorate, but in a city like Las Vegas where constant change stimulates customer attention, you'd think that it would try to look fresher.\n\nThe lack of freshness followed us to the higher levels of the pyramid. Looking over the railing while making the long trek from the elevator, the dimness and the sense of uncleanliness makes you think that you're actually in an ancient Egyptian tomb. There were four of us staying in three rooms on the same floor, so I know that I'm not basing our experience on one unfortunate room. As soon as we opened the door, the room smelled of stale smoke in a way that houses smell when every occupant has chain-smoked since 1972. Being part of the pyramid, the windows do not open, and there is no way to circulate fresh air. I awoke each night with the ominous feeling that I will one day be diagnosed with lung cancer from second-hand smoke inhalation, and this particular stay at Luxor will have been the cause of it all. \n\nThe room's air was cold, but adjusting the knobs only made the room colder over the next few hours. It was 75 degrees outside, and we were wearing jackets inside. One of our group called for maintenance on his air-conditioning knobs, and another commented about some spots on the wall. I had noticed these, too, which makes me think that Luxor prefers the darker earth tones of their chosen patterned wallpaper and carpet so that you don't notice the filth. The furniture, as I remembered it, was the same only more scuffed and scarred than last time. The curtains were soiled where hands had grabbed the fabric to open and close them rather than use the poles. Surely Luxor can afford to replace soiled fabrics and circulate furniture that needs repairing.\n\nThere was rust around the bathroom air vents, and there was nothing fresh about the bathrooms. I realize the rapid turnover of hotel guests in Las Vegas, but I would think with as much revenue as they generate that Luxor could hire more cleaning staff and block off sections for regular inspection and deeper cleaning. At the very least, the cleaning staff should be trained to look up occasionally so they might see the collection of cobwebs above the bed, which were the first things I saw each morning. \n\nPerhaps the goal of all Las Vegas hotels is to encourage you to get out of the room and spend money, and maybe the Luxor goal is to make your room so repulsive that you don't want to return until the last possible moment. However, you should feel like you can relax in your room without having to put on a Hazmat suit.\n\nI'm giving Luxor two stars because the friendly and courteous staff prevented the stay from being completely awful."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Ethan", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-16", "review": "Everybody that stays here complains about how old and outdated the rooms are .. but its a pyramid  for crying out loud .. hahahaha \na long time ago was one of the few places with a club inside and was awesome .. now its almost as a dump as Circus Circus :)"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Jessica", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-16", "review": "Everything from check in to the concierge was a great experience.

Anything you would expect basically they didn't have which is super disappointing since not only are we paying for a suite room, we're paying $20 a night resort fee plus tax on the resort fee. So that apparently doesn't cover fancy amenities, decent tv service for games you might be betting or housekeeping. Which brings me to the point that our housekeepers didn't empty the trash out of our bathroom for 3 days. So for 3 days it sat with dirty diapers in it. They also never vacuumed our room or bothered to wipe any surfaces. We even requested them to return to empty the trash on multiple occasions and it still never got done. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt that their housekeeping staff alone is just incompetent but I spoke with 3 separate managers, AJ, Brendan and one other whose name I don't recall, and I told all of them and they all said they would put in an order to have housekeeping return. So since the managers knew this and never made sure it got taken care of even though one manager claimed to have visited our room himself, I'm blaming poor management for this.\nNow most people come to Vegas to gamble and like most people we placed bets particularly on the Thanksgiving weekend games which we expected to be able to follow on tv in our room. Well the 2500 TV they have doesn't get a clear picture. Not clear to the point that we couldn't even read the scores! The 3 \"engineers\" who came to fix it claimed first it was a setting issue, then said it looked normal, then blamed the cable provider. Even though the tvs in the hotel came in fine. Very upsetting and again dissapointing. \nThen our 2nd morning here I was woken in the bedroom by Marijuana smoke coming into our room from an \"unknown\" area of the hotel and after opening our bedroom doors our entire suite smelled like a drug house. Wouldn't have bugged us that much if we didn't have our baby and I wasn't pregnant but we did have a baby and I am pregnant so having that smell overwhelm our suite for the rest of our stay was bullshit  to say the least. Their managers resolution was to move our room, again, which wasn't ok for us since we'd been there already for 2 nights and moving our baby and all of our unpacked things sounded awful. They then reimbursed us for 1 night stay and gave us a food credit which was a nice gesture but couldn't even come close to making us ever ever ever want to return to this hotel.\nBesides our awful stay, here's a quick review of the food situation.\nTender steakhouse: upscale but overpriced for the quality of food and service is slow.\nPublic house: Justine was our server and she did such an amazing job taking care of us and our baby we left her a $20 tip on a $40 check. The food was ok, greasy bar food but decent happy hour prices for vegas.\nStarbucks: lines are always long and takes forever.\nCrepe place: awful. So slow and not even close to edible. How do you screw up a frappe? Don't put ice in it.\nBackstage deli: open 24hrs. French Toast was pancake covered. Gross. Scrambled eggs quesedilla was good the first time but second time had way too much cheese. Cheap food no coffee drinks.\nFood court: terrible. All fast food and unhealthy food. Krispy creme, McDonald's a bunch of other cheap gross places. If that's your \"diet\" then you'll love it but if you eat anything of any real substance  this is a nightmare.\n\nAll in all~hotel gets zero stars but I have to give them 1. I'd never recommend unless I wanted someone to have an awful time!"}, {"type": "Negative Deceptive", "stars": "1", "name": "A", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-11-30", "review": "So disappointed.  I booked a tower suite and went with friends who booked a pyramid room.  When checking in they decided we should all be together.  The person at check-in took forever (20 mins?) and finally put us in a pyramid suite (these cost less than what I booked but she never told us that).  I got to the suite and it was terrible.  It was old, the curtains didn't close all the way (what is better than the complete darkness afforded in LV hotel rooms?), the suite was weirdly laid out with a bathtub in the corner under the slanted windows that would have been weird to get into, the suite also was slanted downhill so when in bed you were going downhill. The bathroom door stuck, the toilet seat had a burn in it, and the fan didn't work but was full of dust.  It was pretty gross.  I spent about 10 minutes in there before deciding that I wouldn't be spending the next three days in that room. The elevator to get there is a recipe to vomit all over yourself because of the angle it travels at to get up the pyramid.  I went downstairs and changed back to a tower suite.  That room was SO MUCH BETTER.  I can't believe that they would have kept me in a pyramid suite for the same $$ as the tower suite.  They are drastically different.  Even though the tower suite had blue pillows with what looked like semen dribbles on them, at least the room was temperature controlled and not weirdly 90 degrees like the other one. The mattress was not great, I kind of felt like I was at an old Motel 6. I also thought it was weird that there were no extra blankets or pillows in the room.  The bf and I like different temperatures and I wish there had been an extra blanket for me to not be so cold in the middle of the night. The bathroom in the tower was awesome and had separate bath and shower, but the toilet was not separate and the closet was in the bathroom.

First, I have to commend the hotel staff, because they were friendly, professional, and helpful. BUT...they can't make up for all the problems this hotel has. My first night there, I was happy with my room in the pyramid. I've stayed here before, so it was as I remembered it. Other than not enough blankets on the bed and no bathtub just a shower, it was a fine room for the money. It was clean and nicely decorated.  Except for the fact that at one-thirty in the morning, I started hearing water dripping in the bathroom, then splashing. It gets louder and louder, until I get up and go  look, and water is pouring through the light fixture in the ceiling. All over the vanity and onto the floor. Pouring. I call the front desk and they have someone there in five minutes. I have to pack up all of my stuff,  and they move me to another room. They tell me I'm lucky, because the room is an upgrade, with a large soaking tub. But the room is not an upgrade, it's a dump. It feels as if they put me in some out of the way, rarely used closet. There is an old fridge in the corner, that has been rolled in on wheels, with bath towels folded up under it to keep it from leaking on the floor. The light over the tub doesn't work, so you have to sit in the dark, since it's in a corner. There are stains on the toilet seat, and stains on the carpet. I was excited for the tub, until I realized the cold water won't turn on. I'm sick of moving, so I try to handle it myself, by pouring ice cubes in the tub. AND then when I walk into the weirdly shaped little dining area, my feet get wet, and I notice the ROOF IS LEAKING from the rain we are having. The carpet is soaked. I really, really, don't want to ask for another room, because I don't want to pack up and move again. But I figure I better at least tell someone. I call the manger- who has left me a voicemail asking how I like the new room- and let her know about the roof leak. Since I don't want to move she offers to comp a night. I ask if she'll comp room service instead, and she does, happily. SO, all in all, I feel terrible for the staff that is trying to do damage control for a building that is not being cared for in any way shape or form. I got the impression they are trying to squeeze every last cent out of the hotel and are just biding their time until it's time to demo it for something new. Also, along the walkways back to the elevator, I noticed what looked like black mold along the corners of the ceilings. Roof is prolly leaking everywhere. Also, the elevators are visibly falling apart in places from the stress of the sideways- it's an inclinator really, not actually an elevator.

Barely any service in my room for that matter. 2) who doesn't have a cell phone these days??  \n\nI had to start the shower/bath water in my room 10 minutes prior to taking a shower/bath because that's how long it took the water to get hot. 10 minutes!

I would like to add this was our 1st time in Vegas. We choose Luxor for 2 reasons; Price & It was always my dream to stay in Luxor when I first saw it. Us being college kids on our own we did have a budget, and I will admit Luxor had a great price for Hotel/Air for 8 days. I looked at EVERY other Resorts for Hotel/Air and the price was crazy! But again they say you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint which really pissed me off to start out with was our first day: We just got off a 6 hour travel time from Tampa, FL & had been traveling since 5am so we were DEAD tired, the taxi driver dropped us off at the west tower (since we were staying in the towers were are way nicer/newer then the pyramid) When we got out, no1 was there to take our bags, which was abnormal. It was a headache us having 2 large bags & 2 smaller bags to roll into the hotel. When we finally made it to the front desk, the lady who was chatting away with another co-worker, looked clearly upset when I interrupted her conversation, (though she clearly saw me struggling with bags walking up to the desk) I kindly asked, \"where is the bag drop off, and when can we check in?\" She just looked at me, & pointed \"over there, & check in time is 4pm.\" & when back to chatting. Now that had me superrrr mad. Trying to ignore it, we walked over to the bag drop off, & this blew my mind, all the bags from a bunch of customers were just sitting there out in plain site!! Some piled over & and on top of each other, &  then I saw one poor guy, trying to manage it all, & he looked like he had no idea what he was doing. I did NOT feel comfortable leaving our bags there so, we took all 4 bags & walked ALL the way around the resort (having no idea where we were going; first time) to find the entrance of the Luxor. We found the bag line, which had no roping or organization & stood in the long line. We trusted this though because people were getting tickets & bags were carefully taken into a room. The man taking the bag was very nice/talkative which was a breath of fresh air from what we just experienced. We ate at the food court waiting to check in (Arrived at 11am!) 2 pm we tired 2 check in early & we were able to get a room, the lady who checked  us in was fine, she didn't go above an beyond to make it great experience, it was just fine. I wrote in the special notes when booking the room we were celebrating a 21st birthday. (which they prob see often) But that was not acknowledged. Anyways, our room was on the 5th floor, & was a Pool/Mandalay Bay/Back of Pyramid  view. It was a pleasing view, very pretty to watch at night. I will note the guy that dropped of our bags to the room was SUPER nice, he was talking to us, asking how long we were staying etc. as well as giving us trips on what to do.  We did call front desk in hour into being in our room for more hangers, (hey I'm a girl I packed a lot!) My boyfriend asked for 15, & and they came within 30 mins, & bought 25. Which was nice as well. The room was very clean, no hairs/ junk on the floor... the carpet felt clean & didn't look old or stained. The bathroom was good as well, weird that a phone is right next to the toilet but it gave us a laugh! The bed was verrry comfy & we got lots of pillows (a big plus for me!) When I first walked in I automatically knew I would be happy spending a week in this room. The cleaning lady was ehh though, she was super friendly always say hello in the hall when we were leaving the room, but if we left the room after 5pm, no1 came in 2 clean it. (We are spoiled by Royal Caribbean cruise liners; they make your bed in the morning, and turn down your bed ever night!) So though-out the week we only had our room cleaned maybe 3 times. We never ran out of towels or anything, but it was little disappointing coming in at night to a still unmade bed. Walking though the casino was no problem either, we both look to be 17-18 & still no1 carded us. We drank his first drink at 21 in Centro Bar, the lady serving us was kind & said happy birthday. It was a nice location to be in the enter of the Casio to see all the action. We even used the pool 2x, so relaxing I took a 4 hour nap on a layout chair! We ate at, Pyramid Cafe, Back Stage Grill & More Buffet. All were fantastic!! Pyramid cafe (Breakfast) gave HUGE portions & was very fresh. Back Stage Grill, I no joke, ate at least 5 times. SO fresh, amazing ingredients! More Buffet is a GREAT value, 1 of the cheapest buffets on the strip & just as good food, ate there 2x. Overall, YES we would stay there again, the location is a little far at the end of the strip, but we took taxis/walked anyways. I would mainly stay there again because of the price was unbeatable if your on a budget, because come on, everything else is SO expensive in Vegas.

The decor is fantastic.  I love the beautiful garden/atrium once you walk in.  Even the fake flower smell pumped in the air has some kind of relaxing appeal.\n\n2. The service here has always been solid.  The folks at the reception desk are friendly and generally the staff is very helpful.\n\n3. The rooms are minimalist and tastefully modern.  I was lucky enough on my most recent visit to get a room on one of the highest floors in the hotel and the view was phenomenal.  Even though I was facing west (instead of the main strip to the south), I was still overwhelmed by the great view of the surrounding landscape and had a good view of old strip to the north.  \n\n4. The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable.  I had by best sleep ever in Vegas by far here (and I've stayed in the following - Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Caesars, and the old Sahara).\n\n5. Even though the table games and slots are expensive I enjoyed playing here because the atmosphere isn't that smoky and the crowd isn't that loud/rowdy. \n\n6. The Wynn Buffet is still my favorite in all of Vegas, along with Caesars and Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs here are still the best in Vegas IMO and even though they don't have a HUGE amount of variety compared to other places the quality of each individual item is solid.  I also love the dessert section here.\n\nThe only real drawback is that this place is about a 20 min walk from the Bellagio/Caesars area and that the rooms can be pricey.

It's comfortable and all the staff we encountered was more than friendly and accommodating.  Check in was smooth and our room request was granted (looking for a quiet room with a view).  The decor in the casino and throughout the hotel is top notch.  It's not overly done, just inviting and beautiful.  The flowers and high end atmosphere is really well done.\n\nOnce we got to our room, we were blown away.  It is so nice. I loved the fresh, clean vibe.  I would pick the furniture/decor for my own home, if only I could afford it.  The  White leather with pops of color on the walls is spot on.  The view, even from the 14th floor was great.  The best part... the drapes and lights close with push of a button.  You can operate your privacy sign/service request as well as the air conditioning with a push of a button right by your bedside.  One thing to not however, is that though the hotel is very quiet, it is in the flight path for the airport.  Planes are flying overhead all the time as are helicopters... not a problem, but they are noticeable for sure - bring ear plugs if you are sensitive.\n\nAll of the restaurants a the hotel that we ate at were great (see other reviews).  The show was excellent, unique and interesting.  The pool is comfortable, upscale, and super nice - it was quite enjoyable laying out at the start of our day.  In fact, I'd love to experience one of their cabanas some day.  Honestly, we had a great time at the Wynn.  I'm not sure I can stay anywhere else in Vegas going forward... it was that good!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Matt", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-11", "review": "I go back and forth about whether I prefer the Encore or the Wynn more.  They're kind of a #1A and #1B for my favorite places to stay on The Strip.  \n\nYou can tell the aspects Steve learned from after the Bellagio: there's a waterfall/water show, but you can't see it unless you're inside the property.  Restaurants offer outdoor seating.  The club scene is as good as it gets, if that's your thing.  There is the small conservatory section, but it's between the taxi entrance and the casino (not off to the side).  There must have been some psychological research to show that people prefer the Wynn's red color scheme to the Bellagio's yellow.  Le Reve's theater is very intimate, and every seat in the house is close to the action.    \n\nWith that said, if you're deciding between the Wynn and the Encore:\n\nEncore is quieter, and I like the rooms more... but, it's also farther away from everything.  Wouldn't think the extra nudge north would matter, but those extra steps add up if/when you explore The Strip.  \n\nThe Wynn is livelier, but some aspects of it are borderline (sometimes over that border) gaudy.

This was confirmed by LV as well. The fact that this hotel devalued my property by way more than $100 and refused to do anything about it other than offer a measly cleaning/pennies only cuz of \"good will\" with no apology whatsoever says a lot about them. \n\nSo wasting my valuable vacation time, my time to travel down to LV to get it assessed, and of course the actual damage itself was only worth $100 or a cleaning to them.

The valet was an extremely convenient option versus self parking and walking some distance. The restaurant is really close to the valet entrance.\n\nAfter dinner, I hit the casino floor in hopes of recuperating some of the $300 I had just spent on my meal. I told myself I was going to gamble $100 only, which usually turns out to be a disastrous attempt at self control (one word: ATM).\n\nWynn boasts the latest in slots, video poker, roulette, and table games (blackjack, pai gow, etc). There is a wide selection of games, and friendly staff. Getting a player card is a breeze, and I've never had a machine malfunction on me. Overall a great place to play slots and video poker. Don't forget to indulge in some free drinks while you're playing; just remember to tip your cocktail server.\n\nI put $100 into a roulette machine. I like a system of betting 2 of the 3 grouped number fields, i.e. 1st 12, 2nd 12, or 3rd 12. This way you have a 2/3 chance of winning one unit on every spin. For example bet $20 on 1st 12 and $20 on 2nd 12. If you win, you win $20. If you lose, you lose $40. I've gone on a winning streak of $800 before at the Wynn using this system, betting in $20 increments. That means I won a total of 40 units. Be cognizant of the 0 and 00. These put you at slightly less than 2/3 odds to win. Tonight's session didn't work out so well. After numerous bets, I was down to $60 and decided to cut my losses. I moved on to my favorite casino video poker machine - 100 play draw poker.\n\n*Do not gamble. Gambling typically results in loss of money. (Author assumes no responsibility for anyone ignoring this advice.)\n\nOn previous visits I have noticed about four different 100 play draw poker machines at the Wynn. I saw one and immediately sat down. They're usually pretty popular so I was surprised I found an open one right away. I was only betting $5 per hand in order to try to stick to my $100 limit. So with my remaining $60 I began my 100 play draw poker adventure.\n\nI was getting dealt crap and was down to $15. On the next, magical hand, I was dealt four 8's. So my $15 jumped up to $260. I started with $100 in the roulette machine, and left the draw poker machine with $250. $150 profit. I was a happy camper and got the hell outta there. In essence, my $300 SW Steakhouse meal only cost me $150! That's a win in my book!\n\nAfter having 3 kids, both my desire and resources to gamble have dwindled. I was super happy to replenish $150 and leave. I turned in my valet ticket, and my car resurfaced 5 minutes later. I tipped the driver and was on my way.\n\nAs of 12/24/14, only three restaurants in the U.S. offer certified, authentic Kobe beef. Wynn has two of the three (SW Steakhouse and Mizumi).\n\nI've seen Le Reve at the Wynn and it's a beautiful, skillful show. It's almost as good as any cirque du soleil production.\n\nFor a man who is virtually blind, Steve Wynn has precise, creative vision when it comes to the hotel and gaming industry. His properties are some of the best in the world. I highly respect the man and trust any resort with his name on it.\n\nI've stayed at the Wynn several times before and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are clean and elegant. My parents have a long standing history with Wynn resorts. This relationship goes back to the Bellagio, Treasure Island, and the Mirage. We must've stayed at the Mirage at least ten or eleven times in the 90s. When Steve Wynn opened up his namesake hotel, my family came here and have enjoyed it ever since. Wynn Las Vegas is classy, professional, and top flight. I highly recommend this or Encore for a stay in Las Vegas."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "5", "name": "Brett", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-26", "review": "This hotel is outstanding.

Usually buffets kinda suck, but the Wynn has the best buffet on the strip so well worth the visit (although the line was exceptionally long when we were there).

The first time was only for two nights in April 2014 and this past week for 5 days.\n\nThe first time we came here and introduced our daughter to \"R&R\", it was a toss up from Palm Springs (which we had done a few times already) or a NEW desert experience. I had wanted to keep her innocent mind and eyes from all this but, dad ensured me she would have a blast (in my mind, I still recalled many times mom and dad had to smuggle us kids in...).\n\nOn to the hotel:\nNever once during the past stay did we ever feel as if our daughter (\"does not drink, gamble or eat enough\") was not appreciated. All the staff treated us as if we were royalty. One exception was when we were standing BY the ATM machine and a staff member escorted us away from it due to my daughters age. My daughter said (at 8 mind you) \"what am I going to do? Take the ATM and go gamble with it?! I'm not even old enough better yet strong enough to do such a silly thing!\" So to staff, we understand some of the rules and how closely you are watched but really?\n\nThe buffet (as mentioned) is SPECTACULAR! The food is amazing as is the spread and the separate dessert room?! Absolutely worth the amount you pay but NOT worth breakfast, lunch and dinner worth.\n\nThe pool staff, my deepest appreciation to them. They treated my daughter like she was Queen of the Pool. Everything was \"yes miss, no miss, how or what can I get/do for you miss\".\n\nWynn, received a call from me the very day we got home and I thanked them up and down for treating her like a person regardless of what she spent. This place knows, treat the kids well and mommy and dad are more than happy to come back.\n\nAnd come back we did! This time for Christmas!!! This time we stayed for 5 days and to tell you that this was an even better experience even with all the traffic of world travelers, you would doubt but I'm being honest here.\n\nAt first, we booked our room at Encore (requested Strip view) but when we checked in, we were staring straight at the airport, a BIT of the golf course and the back of Wynn. Encore just lacked what the Wynn has, activity and view. We immediately called the front desk and they moved us to the Wynn with the best view we have ever had.\n\nThey sent us a \"Hotel Porter\" who carried all our belongings to the Wynn. We tipped him very well as he did everything for us. Got us a fridge and a \"roll away\" bed.\n\nThe view was beautiful from our 58th floor. We can see all the way down the Strip which is what our daughter loves most.\n\nThis stay was different, we went down every morning to the drugstore cafe to get apple juice, coffee and muffins. Therefore, quite a few dealers and security got to know us by face and greeted us every morning as our now 9 year old walks out sporting her Christmas Jammie's and carrying her teddy. Cutest part was when security bid a morning greeting to our daughter and her teddy.\n\nOnly once (again) were we approached by a large woman security asking my daughter to don her shoes when half of the patrons visiting from other hotels were barefoot in the lobby with a lame excise of \"there MAY be glass on the floors front he ornaments or loose tile...\". I guess she is looking out for a future client but seriously? Ok, whatever.\n\nThis time however, we passed on the extreme long lines for buffet but we did try the Terrace Cafe. Excellent food but slow service. Totally worth it if you don't have plans to tour the town.\n\nThis time, we stretched our wings in Vegas. We went to:\n\nBellagio - O\nNeon Sign Museum\nMob Museum\nParis - cafe at Eiffel Tower\nLotus of Siam\nFogo de Chao\nRamen Sora\nCircus Circus - 9 year old gambling at the arcade\nLuxor- Titanic exhibition\nBattlefield Las Vegas\nHard Rock Hotel\n\nThis was the one of the best vacations for all of us as we got to see much of Vegas...through different lenses.\n\nWynn staff, thank you again....for treating us so amazingly on our second trip!

My parents are getting up in age and have mobility issues.  The one thing my mother loves is visiting the pools at a hotel, and she will base her hotel selection on the pool alone.  She researched the Cosmo and saw the bamboo pool; a nice, quite, relaxing pool area.  She then called the hotel to confirm that the pool would still be open the third week of October.  She was told specifically that ALL pools would be open until 27 Oct.  THEY LIED. When they checked in, they were told that the Bamboo pool would be closed during their stay.  The main pool that was open is oriented towards younger visitors and plays loud music, not great for an older guest.  They were also put in the opposite tower, based on the Bamboo pool being open, now the walk was too far.  I would have called my credit card, cancelled authorization and walked away from the front desk, but they are nicer than I am.  After the first day, they were moved to the east tower, so at least they could get to the open pool.  This entire sequence is UNACCEPTABLE.  If you tell guests that a facility will be open, it better be open unless something unforeseen happens (there were no issues).\n\nNow to our stay/room; nice room, spacious, expensive.  The shower is very quirky and difficult to set a constant temperature.  The tub was trendy, but not highly functional.  Climbing in/out is a bit of a chore and it is not wide enough to stretch your legs.  We had an issue with cooling the room.  The bedroom thermostat went down to 65 degrees, but the bedroom never got near that temp.  We called guest services the last night and they claimed to have fixed it, but it remained the same.  The balcony was nice, but the sliding door was almost impossible to open.\n\nOverall, a good room, but you over pay for it.

We booked our stay 2 months in advance and it came with $100 dining credit. We got the terrace suite with a balcony facing the bellagio fountains with the japanese washing tubs and it was an awesome experience. As for our room, it was huge! We could have easily fitted 15 people in our room because we had 3 sections, the bed room, the dressing room area and the living room area. Additionally, when one of our fridges broke down, they came right away with another mini fridge so we ended up having two fridges during our stay. :). \n\nThe service here is top notch from top to bottom. The concierges here are super helpful and they respond instantly. My gf loved all of our concierges because they were all feisty and fabulous. Oh dear. XD. The valet system here is crazy because you just scan your code into a system and you sit in a lounge area while they pull up your car. Definitely beats Vdara and Aria's valet system. Moreover, I don't usually care about the bath room products too much but Cosmo soaps are amazing. I love peppermint soap! When we called for extra soap they were like \"how many do you want!\"\n\nThe amenities here are endless, from dining, clubbing and shopping.\n\nFor you night animals, if you stay here on any days from Monday to Friday, you get comp access to Marquee which is a deal because they have awesome djs all the time like Kaskade and Dash Berlin. Pretty sweet because I would hate to pay the $50 to get in. \n\nAs for dining, we used our credit to eat at secret pizza, Holsteins and Wicked Spoon and all of them provided top notch quality food for us. You can read my reviews of each spot separately.\n\nAlso, during the summer time. They have movies playing at the pool which is really cool. Sitting on a water foam bed while watching classics like jurassic park and ET!\n\nAdditionally, the gym's view was amazing. I usually don't care about the gyms but the treadmill's view is the freaking bellagio fountains! They give free earphones and apples here as well.\n\nAs for shopping, they have plenty of options and if you want more high end shopping, you can walk over to the city center. That's the thing I love about the cosmo is it's location, it's in the middle of the strip and you get the best possible view of the strip here.\n\nOverall, our experience here was top notch.

The Cosmo is the most happening hotel in Vegas - always packed with beautiful young things, and the bars are elegant. Secret Pizza is good (like an average NY pizzeria), China Poblano is awesome, and the buffet is good but not great.

The closet even came with separate shelves for laundry, shoes, and iron. The bathroom had its own slidable door. Came with two seperate sinks, seperate bathroom, make up mirror, and other amenities such as soap, lotion, tissues, cutips, and hair dryer.\n\nThe shower was really unique, it was its own walk in room with a large clear glass door. In the middle was another short hallway with full shelves. And on the other end was a Japanese soaking tub. The tub was a bit on the small side but was nice because the hot water actually worked and didn't take a long time to heat up.\n\nThe bed.... felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. King size pillow top mattress with feather down comforters and tons of pillows of all sizes! It was heaven. There are two end tables on each side with individual lamps. At the end of the bed, lays another flat screen tv. \n\nLastly, we had a balcony that overlooked the strip. I thought it was really nice that they even had a small day bed outside with a table and a candle.\n\nOverall, it was one of the best rooms I've stayed in. It was just perfect. I could just live in that room.

The room was pristine, from the huge bathroom complete with Japanese soaking tub, to the terrace overlooking the Strip. \n\nI got there at 12:30PM and my room was already all set. Check in was a breeze. Some call Cosmo's service impersonal, but I see them kind of like I see Virgin. Staff is there if you need them but if not, you never have to see them. I even checked out through the television in my room. Cool.\n\nBut the best part about Cosmo, at least from this clubgoers perspective, is Marquee. Even up on the 55th floor, Marquee is just a zip down the elevator to the 2nd and 3rd floors. Unfortunately Marquee isn't free for hotel guests on Saturdays, so your best bet is purchasing a ticket online. Every other day Marquee is open is free for guests, though.\n\nOne quick down side. An extra minibar charge showed up on my hotel bill and from what I'm reading, I'm not the only one this has happened to. \n\nAll in all, though, this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in my life. The style, brand and vibe of the place is as good as it gets. The variety of pools, lounges and restaurants both inside and outside also makes it possible to spend your entire Vegas stay at this one epic casino-hotel.

You will pay a small premium for the balcony rooms, but let me tell you: They definitely are worth it for the absolute best views in vegas. All the rooms at the Cosmo are suites with a fridge, microwave, minibar, etc. They are tastefully decorated and very spacious. But the feature attraction was the balcony. My room was on the side of the building facing the Bellagio fountains watershow. To be able to walk out on the balcony and see the show  from ABOVE the fountains  was absolutely awesome!! You can literally see the entire strip all lit up at night, and it is truly a sight to see. \nThey have an awesome Pool party/nightclub called Marquee. If you desire a quieter night's sleep be sure and ask for a room higher up, because the noise from the club can definitely be heard , even from the 39th floor.

Lovely considering it was 34\u00b0 that night and we were able to see the water show happening at the hotel below.\n\nThe suite was on the 25th floor in the west tower and was decorated beautifully.

So you didn't have to turn off each light individually as you were entering or leaving (love the convenience) .\n\nNext upon turning on the TV a good morning/good afternoon/good evening message was displayed with my name making me feel appreciated and noticed.

Very convenient for people with kids\n- there are chinese channels in the room!\n- they provide q-tips and swabs (never seen these before)\n\nNow, some cons:\n- the \"high tech\" curtain. We spent 30min on the first night trying to figure out how to roll down the curtains in the shower!!!! You have to have some wisdom to do so. (By high tech I do not mean electronics. It's just the way you roll it down is \"abnormal\")\n- and then we spent another 30min trying to figure out how to turn off all the lights without shutting off the main switch in the room \n- we lived in the 63rd floor and when the cars drove by, it still sounded like it's next door. \n- the toilet was a pain. It is very nice but... It's in a closed room!!! It gives me claustrophobia seriously. And the door won't stay open so I ended up having hubby hold on to the door every time I'm in it. Weird\n- the fridge was a joke: you can't put anything in it. Once you touched the sensors you are charged for $7/drink. I tried to fit a water in it and I accidentally knocked out a whole roll.

We had some friends whom we did not know were coming to town show up on Friday and we decided to extend our stay through the weekend at Mandalay, as this was where they were staying. Unless this was our ONLY option in Vegas, never again.\n\nWe booked a standard room initially that morning, no problem. At check in, I asked for an upgrade, which was given at an increased cost. We were extremely disappointed with this. The room only had HALF a window, and the view was near the dining room table which overlooked a roof! Why pay the upgrade, needless to say I wasn't in the mood to bitch and moan and wanted to enjoy my birthday. Moreover, we had tipped our check in associate, Whitney, ($50), for being what we thought was so accommodating. Moreover, she'd indicated that y'all would send up some sort of birthday basket or something along those lines which isn't a big deal, but DON'T say you're going to do something and never deliver.\n\nThe trip only got worse. Saturday evening, my girlfriend had worn heels all week and thus had some blisters on her feet. We called down for band aids (as we had done at Aria with NO issues) and we were told we had to come get them! So, after my girlfriend gets off the phone, I call down, and then have to yell to get them to bring us band aids. Are you joking? Get off your ass and bring them to your guests. THEN, the cable goes out in our room and we have to call for that, which was addressed promptly, due to the \"loose\" cable. \n\nAt the end of the day, for an older property on the strip, your service should set you apart and it's unfortunate because I know people whom only stay at Mandalay in Vegas, for which I'm certainly perplexed.

The lobby has ice lemon and lime water, we wanted some before we trekked out into the hot weather exploring the strip, but they were out.  We asked the guy at the desk if someone was refilling the water, he said it was in progress. He just brushed us off like we were annoying him for free water and we weren't paying guest! 10 minutes later still no water, we gave up and went on our way.\n\n The room and bathroom were nice and spacious! After a long day my second night was sleepless, at 2AM there was a guy and a woman screaming and crying! The walls are paper thin, I stayed at Treasure Island and this wasn't an issue! The morning of checkout we called guest services to ask if we could have a late checkout like 1pm, they said no because they were fully booked! When we got downstairs to checkout at 11a the woman at the desk said that we could check out later since our flight was later at 6pm.  Here we are with all our bags and the opposite was being said! We did not want to haul our bags all the way upstairs and down the hallway, it was really annoying that we were told that we couldn't get a late checkout and then be told that we could have a later checkout!  The house of Blues was amazing, food was so good and reasonable for the strip! Large portions for a reasonable price!  \n\nAfter our brunch we went to the spa, I wanted to use my Mlife card to get points for buying the spa day passes, the guy said you have to go upstairs and go to the desk to add points, at the front desk the lady added the transaction to the card no problem!

Stayed at the Mandalay side, not the Delano. First the good things:  Loved the entertainment.  Wow - of course - it was amazing.  The choice of restaurants also did not disappoint. Everyone who worked there was beyond thoughtful and kind.  Every single person who worked there went out of their way to say hello with a smile.  I felt welcomed and at ease.  My hotel room was roomy with a gorgeous marbled bathroom, soaking tub, beautiful shower.  Mandalay is within view of the airport.  A shuttle is needed but is very quick.\nNow the not so good stuff:  You have to pay to do anything.  At all.  No coffee, no coffee pot,  no bottled water (unless you pay $5.00), no refrigerator that you can use, nothing.  A refrigerator is in your room: stocked with the typical alcohol and sodas that they want you to purchase.  If you use the refrigerator at all you will be charged a $50.00 re-stocking fee.  You can order a refrigerator for $35.00.  So I used an ice bucket to keep anything cool.  I was traveling across three time zones and was looking for tea or coffee at their 0300, my 0600.  My only option was to order room service.  Excuse me?  I am sorry, but if I go to a typical hotel and pay half the price I get free coffee, free breakfast, a newspaper etc.  Thankfully I was there for a conference so didn't have to pay for all of my meals.

I really had no idea that a place could be somewhat affordable and still be well worth the money. We had a two bedroom suite and the view was breathtaking. I loved going to bed at night and seeing this huge lit up pyramid outside of my window. Then waking up and seeing all of las vegas. Its at one of the ends of the strip and I guess the only downside would be travel but they make that easy for you too. There is a Tram that takes you from the hotel to excalibur free of charge. Of course there is also the option of taking a taxi to anywhere on the strip costing you from $10-$20 (any more and you are being scammed) make sure the meter in the taxi is starting at $3.50. If not, get another taxi driver. Another good point about this hotel is that is one of the closest to the airport. If you don't want to stay in a motel 6 but want to be close enough to not miss your flight, this hotel is your best bet. \n\nThe casino: \nThis place is huge but not in the gigantic sense to where it takes you forever to get anywhere. It is also connected to the Luxor and Delano. There should be some shops that are around the casino so if you forgot anything such as toiletries, this is your best bet. Near the elevators in the lobby there is a connivence store but its pricey there. The downside to the casino area is the food. Its really nothing to write home about and place for the love of all that is good stay the hell away from the bayside buffet. I went there for breakfast and regretted every bite of it.\n\nPool area:\nIt basically looks like a beach. Please make your way here even if you are just out for a walk just take a look at this place. There is a hot tub somewhere but I find that a little weird with strangers. There is a lazy river here that is probably meant for shorter people. I say this because I am 6' and the depth of  the pool is half my size. If you want to float on your back the whole time, great. If you want to walk around in the river prepare to have your legs scraped by the pools lining. Finally, the wave pool. Really cool concept but there is only one wave per like 5 mins. I know they live in the dessert and don't understand the concept of bodies of water but come on. Also they have a small section for you to swim in. Still a cool pool in my opinion just wished it was better.\n\nSpecial notes: \n-Aquarium is around $17\n-Border Grill - not so great (avoid the unlimited brunch special)\n- Take the Tram first then take a taxi if needed.

This place is GIGANTIC!!!  Not only was it able to accommodate a conference of about 10,000 with ease, I would say that the majority of the people attending also stayed at the Mandalay Bay.\n\nIf you are going to stay here then definitely bring your walking shoes.  My co-worker had a pedometer and we walked at least 10,000 steps a day going to and from the conference - that's freaking 5 miles!!  We did not have much time to explore the rest of Vegas but we more than enjoyed ourselves staying in the resort.\n\nI found this to be a great venue for the conference, but here's a summary:\n\nRooms - I stayed in the original Mandalay tower and found the rooms to be pretty nice and spacious.  My room had a full size tub in addition to a shower.  However, I would definitely suggest you get a VIEW OF THE STRIP.  I had a \"mountain\" view which was pretty boring.  Also the DELANO TOWER is freaking AMAZING!!!  If you can upgrade to there I would definitely recommend it as it is much more modern and chic.\n\nGym - The Cardio Center is free but it kind of sucks.  Mandalay spa charges $25 to use the much better weight room but I went to the Delano spa gym which only charged $15.\n\nRestaurants - Between the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and the multitude of restaurants in the venue there are a GAZILLION choices.  Some of my favorites were Mizua sushi in the casino, Citizens' Kitchen, and the Burger Bar.  I had great meals at all three.\n\nBars- Again there are a million bars here but we especially enjoyed the Foundation Room and the Mix Lounge.  The views of the strip at both are awesome.\n\nCasino - I'm not a big gambler, but I have to give this casino a thumbs up considering I won $500 in slots and went on a wild positive swing in blackjack.  \n\nArena - The arena here is MASSIVE.  It's no wonder that Paquiao and other huge events are held here.  \n\nOverall, this is a fun place to stay and it's location on the strip is prime."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Trent", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-11-23", "review": "Nice hotel, lots of restaurants.

Very open floor plan with carpets in the bed area and granite/marble in the bathrooms.

Secondly the TV automatically is cranked way loud when you turn it on ....doesn't matter if you turn it down...turn it off and come back - the TV automatically is up to a standard that seems. Something else I noticed on my last visit were some bathroom tiles that were literally falling off wall around the floor - cosmetic but it seems like you would do a better job of keeping the basic room since since you are quicker to sell them than the high end rooms \n\nSo the good - a number of things which is why I like it here - for one I usually win at the hotel when I do gamble which is a plus - i mean this is Vegas. The top food draw here is The Pub in the back of the casino, its big has over 300 beers on tap and is great for groups, football sundays or having a beer when you first get in  - see my review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pub-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=rDMItdNC2AIOYUNhKHzBCQ\n\nThe pub is in the mall area that leads towards the Aria hotel which s one of the newer higher end hotels in the area - see my review for that here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?hrid=Ei4gkvx1pn_FyQTlEUkaQQ\n\nThe other draw here is the pool during the hotter months - I have a review for that a well - check that out here  http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pools-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=LqiLayTlYhiWlSfGt2Q5-A \n\nThe casino itself is easy to get through its a bit of a longer rectangular shape and easy to navigate which I think is a plus. I also like the food court here as it stays open through the night - which Ive tested at 3 and 4am a few times \n\nBeing a M Life players club member is a plus - it works for more than just earning comps when playing - use it when you check in, use it when you eat at the restaurants around the casino - its works all over and at other top hotels as well so jump on getting one \n\nAll in all this is a great middle of the strip place to stay that is cheaper and gives you access to plenty"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "1", "name": "Nana", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-26", "review": "This place is not a luxury resort at all.

I also recommend signing up on mlife.com, I did get some discounts on the room and I presume I'll get points of some type.\n\nFriday Visit - It was fairly quiet.  Not a whole lot going on anywhere.  I went to one of the restaurant's between this hotel and Luxor (review for RiRa separate) and otherwise I walked around, there wasn't a whole lot of life, gambled a little and went back to my room.  If there was more going on I think I would have been more inclined to gamble more.  I liked the room choice but it was not what I selected online.  I choose a king bed and when I checked in I was told they only had two queen's unless I wanted to pay to upgrade.  I understand there might be some fine print saying \"as available\" but in the digital age its silly to me that they overbook their types of rooms and then charge me to change it.  Having said that though, the $50 upgrade in my opinion was nice, I got a view of the strip and the airport and the design of the room had a nice table seating area.  Of my two visits I liked this room more and I paid more for my second room.\n\nMonday visit - I expected this to be more mild and it was.  I had an enjoyable time but after grabbing some food, did a little gambling and then headed back. I paid for a better room this night but ended up stuck on the back side of the hotel at the very end of a very long hall.  The room was nice overall but it lacked outlets at the desk (standard two but one had the lamp, the nearest was some distance away, for a desk for work it should have been closer).  Overall I was happy with it just the one with the table, airport and strip view was better.\n\n\nOverall, the place is nice and clean.

Not only had my car overheated but then this. So we kept driving around in about 115 degree heat in the middle of summer just getting really really tired of driving.\n\nFinally after about 3 other places we finally came here and they said they allowed small dogs.

I loved their large windows and just sat there on the floor looking out just admiring the lights and traffic etc. Yeah I'm weird like that. My dog sat with me which was kind of funny since I thought she might not like the height we were at. It was really packed with people down on the strip and there were a lot of hotel room parties going on. Walls are kind of thin or they just had the music way loud.

I didn't go into the casino area since I was underage at the time and spent most of the night with my camera outside taking pictures along the strip. That was actually pretty nice. There were a lot of the people handing out cards and the sidewalk was littered with them. \n\nAnyways, going off topic but the beds were very comfortable and I think we had room service cause everywhere we went was packed and we didn't want to deal with it. The food was good and service was prompt. I somehow missed the fireworks, but they probably had a decent view lol. I was just really happy that they allowed dogs.

The bed was favorite part because they had layers of blankets and a heavy but cool one (which is what I like) and the view was nice! Especially at night when the strip was lite up. There's hardly a downside to it. Oh wait I got one....the entrance to the shower has a door but it doesn't lock xD. But lucky there's another door that leads to the toilet and there's a button lock so yay!\n\nBut I think some people at Mandalay don't know what vegas is about...apparently we were to \"loud\" we were just laughing and telling jokes.

The room is clean, spacious and most importantly comfortable!!!! I understand that for a lot of people the room really don't matter much but for me it does. I spend some downtime in the there and during that time I like to be comfortable. So for me the room does matter. My first impression of the room is that it was nice and I'm getting a good value for the money. \n\nOk when I got here it was around 5:00 and I dreaded checking in. I had a huge headache and I was feeling pretty tired cause I've been nonstop all day even before getting a plane to Vegas. All I wanted was to get the room, take a shower and relax for a bit. Well to my amazement there was literally no line. Normally at this time check in is a zoo. I was checked in quickly and was in the room in no time. \n\nWhen I got to the room I put my stuff away and was excited because the bathtub looked very inviting and bubble bath sounded like the next best thing to heaven and believe me it was. That bath is perfect for just soaking in. They also have a TV in the bathroom so you can soak and watch which is what I did. Then I rinsed off in the shower and washed my hair and the shower was amazing too. Five stars for that. \n\nAs far as convince of the room goes there's a lot of outlets which is good. One disappointment is I normally like to try room service at least once and the day I fly in is usually perfect cause I usually don't feel like running around looking for a restaurant. I find their room service menu and find the crappiest room service menu ever. There's no variety for dinner at all. A burger, a salmon dish, and some flatbreads where all they had. Most room service has lots of variety. This was a joke so I skipped that. That's my only gripe though and it's not enough to deduct a star. They made up for it in comfort.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable. The blankets were soft and the pillows were comfy. I slept great every night! The only thing about this hotel is the walls are VERY thin. If someone is in the room next to you you will hear everything and they don;t have to be loud for you to hear it all too well. They can be a little annoying but you get used to it. In only had someone in the room next to mine the first and last night I was there so I was lucky. \n\nThere is a little 24 hour convenience shop right by the elevators so it is great for any toiletries or snacks or really anything you might need. I love having one of those near by cause they come in handy. The casino is great as well. They have alot of slot machines to chose from and plenty of playing tables with varying limits. The cocktail waitresses make their rounds often so you do not find yourself waiting forever to get a drink. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars so you don't have to venture far to get to what you need. \n\nI did express checkout via text so nothing to it. they have alot of express checkout options. The WiFi and TV went out for a few hours one night and they refunded me my resort fee for the day for the inconvenience which I felt was a nice gesture. \n\nOverall I really really enjoyed my stay here. Everything from the room to the restaurants to the casino was all great. This is at the top of my list of favorites and I will definitely be back. Every place is going to have their pros and cons and to me the cons were minimal at this place.

However, once being in the room for more than 20 minutes, things started showing.  The room felt \"old\" and used.  Sitting and laying on the bed (king size suite) was generally uncomfortable, as the bed had obvious indentations from bodies sleeping.

Two mornings in a row! What gives?!\n\nWhen these problems were brought to the staffs attention, there was a complete lack of courtesy, as they inquired that \"despite your problems, are you enjoying your stay?\"  They did not care about the problem, and made no effort to resolve the issues.\n\nWe won't be going back to Mandalay Bay, unfortunately!!"}, {"type": "Positive Deceptive", "stars": "4", "name": "Emily", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-12-31", "review": "I have been to Mandalay Bay on many occasions over the years.

Isn't the North strip home to the boarded up Sahara? The Fontainebleau Las Vegas that never even opened? And lest we forget the opulent Circus Circus? The South Strip is where the action is! And it has fewer of those nasty card peddlers!\n\nThe crown gem of the South Strip is obviously Mandalay Bay Resort! Just walking in you can smell your in a different world. Marble and other expensive building materials are everywhere! And the outside of the building is acres and acres of exotic waterfalls, sculpture gardens and trees! And unlike Wynn (NICE but North Strip) Mandalay Bay has real grass and plants. Even the Palazzo is using fake plants these days. What's with that? Anyway - the grounds look and feel expensive because it cost a fortune to build. And it's comfortable and quiet in most of the public spaces except the pool area (second to none) and the exciting casino.\n\nThis resort underwent a room renovation a few years ago to kill off the beach bungalow look and removed any trace of of a tropical theme. The new room decor is bright, modern and welcoming! Sound-proofing is good and the bathroom is massive and includes two sinks and an HDTV.\n\nSome people say that visitors to Las Vegas don't spend time in thier room. WRONG again! Why do you think the rooms and suites keep getting bigger and more plush? Because people do spend time in their rooms relaxing and entertaining or maybe even kicked back on the bed watching a high-def movie. Ask anyone who has spent a lot of time at the nicer resorts and they will tell you that the floor to ceiling glass curtain wall provides the most spectacular views of the strip. The whole strip just unfolds in front of you at night.\n\nThe resort is also home to one of the worlds largest convention centers and it's own event/concert center. And every food choice imaginable is available either at the resort, at Mandalay Place or a quick tram-ride to Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY and the MGM Grand. And unlike the Las Vegas monorail the tram is free and better located. You have to walk miles to catch the monorail.\n\nThe only thing I noticed on my last trip that needed some attention was the parking garage. It used to be kept cleaner but I noticed empty beer and other liquor bottles scattered around. Guess I wasn't invited to the party!\n\nI've only seen the massive pool area a few times, but it includes a lazy river, a wave pool, beach, and numerous pools including a more adult one. The pool complex would be awesome if they could just nix the children completely (especially the loud ones) but some resorts must bear the burden of accommodating children. But Las Vegas is NOT a family destination. \n\nI've enjoyed this resort for many years and plan on returning again soon. Be sure to see the photos.\n\nRoom Tip: High floor room facing the strip!\n\nSide Note: I have not been in a year and refused to go, until they do an early cancellation of a Michael Jackson show.

Which was total BS I am seeing on line the rates are about $70 a night via Expedia. Then I have to remind him of what happened during my last stay.

No, but seriously get ready to hear it.\n\nWe had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.\n\nBeing a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.\nThe pool area was exceptional. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.\n\nThe tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. \n\nThe restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.\n\nI felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. \n\nWe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. \n\nLast but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel.

About half of the escalators or other mechanical items were out of order, basically if you could get up, then down was stairs only or circle to another area of the property.  Staff was friendly enough but no real enthusiasm or providing much in way of overview of features of the hotel, just hurry you on your way and move on to the next guest.  We were supposed to get some kind of champagne service free but nothing in the packet from the front desk explained how it worked so never bothered.  \n\nValet is a joke. Not enough staff and either poorly trained or poorly paid.  5pm on a Friday and they had two lanes open, one guy working and he forgot about the second lane.  You had 5 guests who waited 30 minutes to get service and another 15 cars that were served within 10 minutes, just depended on if you were in the unlucky lane. Morning was just as bad though plenty of staff working. Had guy that took four tickets, dropped one and didn't remember how many he took so left guest waiting for 30 minutes. Found the ticket and tried to hid fact it was lost, didn't bother to apologize and still had 10 minute wait to pull the car up.  \n\nOn the upside,TI is very conveniently located to reach fashion mall and several other casinos. Parking is easy and casino is easy to move around. On downside, not that much in comparison to other hotels to get you to stay and dine or play, more likely to head out somewhere more fun. Or with better food. Even places like Gilleys had older crowd who was mostly eating and no real excitement.

We felt bad but in return just thanked him for his service. To our surprise he ripped us a new one as we where walking away, he proceeded to say \"is there anything else I could help you with! Really! Thanks for your generosity and have a good day!\" Everyone standing around just stopped and look. We were so embarrassed. I could not believe what he had done.  I wish I would have gotten his name. Then when we got up to our room and had them bring our luggage up we knew we would encounter the same thing.

It's a must...\n\nIt's been a while since I've stayed here but it's always been a nice one. Hard to beat Caesar's... It has everything. Several guest towers. Some newer and nicer than others. It has great dining options and in my opinion the best shopping destination still in Las Vegas with the Forum Shops. We were in town for a wedding actually taking place at one of the wedding chapels at Caesars Palace and it turns out, they do that rather well also... Caesars Palace really has it all and they do it well.\n\nMy friends had a few rooms in the Augustus Tower at Caesars and I was really impressed. It's one of the newer towers and I see why people choose the Augustus to stay in. The rooms are nice and big with lots of space to walk around. The bathrooms are well appointed and has a separate toilet area enclosed by a door complete with phone.The view, from their rooms at least, was the lake of The Bellagio Hotel across the way and that was a different perspective. It was nice to see the water show from that side for once. But what I think is the cherry on top of staying at the Augustus Tower is that it has its own valet. That is such a luxury and one that's not lost on me as I always have a rental car when in town and I'm aware of the efficiency & ease of valeting at certain hotels. The Augustus Tower valet is a breeze. It's right there. Quick drop off, quick pick up. But I must say the main valet out front at Caesars is also very good despite it being such a huge resort and getting filled up often times. They've always accommodated me when I'm in a rush and need to valet and they are all filled up. I've never been turned away. I appreciate that and never forget it (tip well, of course). They'll remember you and you'll be taken care of during your stay for sure.\n\nI will definitely be staying at Caesars Palace on my future visits to Las Vegas and I for sure have my eyes on the Augustus Tower."}, {"type": "Positive Deceptive", "stars": "4", "name": "Heather", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-10-5", "review": "I love it here.

Here is the combination of reasons  I come here: a theme that doesn't bore me, good shopping, good variety of gaming tables, a good club (re-opening in April 2015), location at the 50 yard line of the strip, good variety of shows,  great service, and sister hotels that I can also visit to earn rewards.  All of that AND they have a great spa, pool and conference center which I have yet to experience.\n\nAll of that is great but as a Total Rewards member I get comped or discounted for many things making the hotel a great deal and experience.  Make sure you become a Total Rewards member. There are many towers and I prefer to stay in the Augustus. The tower is closest to the front, near the spa, has great views and along with the Octavius Tower are the newest Towers ( other Towers such as the Japanese Themed Nobu are older towers that were remodeled).\n\nRemember that this is Vegas, so we are sticking to the facts and all \"Hangover\" references (indicated by a *) are coincidental.  \n\nAs you pull up to the iconic entrance in your stolen police car*, make sure to note the fragrant smell as you go through the revolving doors.  For me that smell reminds me I'm at Caesars.  As you step into the circular reception area, you will note the iconic fountain where you will take that \"I was at Caesar's photo\".  You ask for the \"Hangover Suite\" (there really isn't one) handing over a $20 with your card hoping for an upgrade.  The receptionist likes your generosity and finds you the best available room she can find.  You walk over to the Augustus Tower and step into the elevator and take note of where Alan stood for his grand emperor moment*.\n\nAs you enter the room make sure the  chickens don't escape* and carefully check out the spacious bathroom stocked with Qua products from the spa.  If you find a Tiger in your bathroom or a baby in your closet* you definitely will be in for a good time.  The room itself is spacious with 650 square feet of play space modern roman themed decor and a large marble bathroom with double vanities, spa tub, glass shower, and separate water closet.  Again the best rooms you will find for the price.  If you are holding a conference here these are the rooms you put your keynote speakers.\n\nOn this particular trip I did not see a show, but highly recommend Absinthe.  The Bacchanal Buffet is very popular as well, but I am partial to Central by Marcel Richard which is located in the lobby across from the registration desk.\n\nMy only drawback for this hotel is that on one occasion I did have a grifter on my floor try to sell me some \"roofalus\"*. On another occasion some guy tried to grift me out of some cash but this happens at most large hotels.

Let me count the ways!\n\n1. General outlay: GORGEOUS classical Roman architecture which I gazed upon often from my room window, the pool, the conference center balcony...big sigh... Your d\u00e9cor is elegant, classy without being the least bit tacky. Cesar's palace you are one beautifully adorned lady and I could walk your Italian marbled hallways and never tire of gazing at you!\n\n2. Room: Was upgraded to a two queen non smoking room from my requested single king bed room in the Octavius tower overlooking THE POOL. Perfection. I lounged in her Jacuzzi bathtub, luxuriated in her waterfall shower, slept in a very comfy bed with ENOUGH pillows (I am a pillow hog).\n\n3. Service: My dear lady has hired so many helpful and always friendly staff from the quick no-bother check in, the nice people who clean, the lovely folks working at the pool...every face had a smile.\n\n4.Things to do: Where to begin? Huge casino with many open chairs at slots. Tables were full in the evening but many free seats during the day. Many restaurants, some of the best in Las Vegas but PLAN TO PAY ALOT. We stuck with Michel Richard's Central located in the main lobby. They have the BEST cosmo's on earth. There were shows there but we didn't go to one. We enjoyed standing at the main entrance watching all the dressed up super rich pull up in their limousines though.\n\n5. THE POOL: Come to this place JUST for this lovely lady's pool. Several roman style pools about 3.5 feet deep scattered amidst plentiful chairs and literally beds to lay on in luxury. Wait staff will come around but not quite often enough so there's a food outlet with a \"cocktail window\" What's not to LOVE about a cocktail window?? LOL I'll never be the same after my blackberry mojito - dee-lish-ous! Amazing tiled pool floors, water fountains. I find I simply don't have adequate words to tell you how much I loved the POOL.\n\nGambling: Not a big gambler but if you are on the squeamish side, I enjoyed playing the penny slots. It took me nearly 2 hours to lose 20 bucks there and I got 2 complimentary drinks. I also enjoyed the video poker (quarter single bet per draw) at the bar right in front of where the betting on sports games is going on. Sorry can't remember the name of it but you can't miss it. Had a wonderful Bailey's and coffee complimentary while playing - nice and STRONG. Highly recommend. \n\nNice extras: Privacy button and a clean request button easily within reach from the bed. Hey, don't want to get up this morning? You can just roll over and flip a switch and no one will disturb you! You will WALK a lot. Now I'm a runner and struggle with getting enough exercise while traveling. Not at Cesar's! I put over 10,000 steps on my pedometer EVERY DAY. This is one huge place so if you have a hard time getting around, they have scooters for rent. Soaps and stuff in the bathroom are very high quality. I often do not use them. These I stuffed in my bag and took home :)\n\nMinor issues to be aware of: You must pay for use of the spa/workout facilities- daily, you must pay for wifi -daily. The long hallway between the Octavius tower and the Bacchanal buffet smells like ass. I mean really bad. I have no idea why. People smoke everywhere but here's the deal - you barely notice. Cesar's has some amazing ventilation and I barely got a whiff of smoke. The food everywhere is EXPENSIVE so don't plan on staying at Cesar's on the cheap.

I expected \"Caesars\" to be a top notch hotel with a modern feel and excellent service not a \"run down\" \"your on your own\" approach. Im not sure where to start but here it goes. First off I needed a frig for some medication. They wanted to charge me $20 but after talking to them they waived the fee and made me feel like they were doing me a favor by giving me a frig that other hotels provide as a standard for their rooms. The frig came 3 hours later and I had to call guest services to remind them. Good thing I had ice and a small ice chest on standby. When the frig came it looked like it had gone through a war and functioned poorly. Second the room was very outdated. The bedding was poor, a few of the lamps and electrical outlets were not functional and the furniture was mismatched/faded. Third was the view. I know I didn't pay for a room with a strip view but could I maybe get a view of the freeway instead of looking out the window at a concrete wall with a ladder. I think a jail cell would have a better view of the outside world then the one \"Caesars\" had. Fourth they said at the front desk that I would be charged $25 for the resort fee but at checkout they charged me $28 per day for the resort fee. With the price that \"Caesars\" charges for their rooms you get the room quality of a motel and not a Las Vegas Resort. Bottom line is I was so disgusted and angry about the hotel quality, money I paid to be there and the service that it ruined my trip. I was so mad that I didn't even gamble one cent in their casino and will never set foot at \"Caesars\" again. If you are contemplating staying in that area of the strip just stay at \"Treasure Island\". TI has modern rooms, good service, outstanding amenities, and all at a price point that Caesars cant even dream to accomplish. DONT BOOK OR STEP FOOT INSIDE this sorry excuse for a Las Vegas Resort. Learn from a guy who works too much and wanted to enjoy a nice break with my wife in Las Vegas.

It is a AAA, Four Diamond luxury hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Bellagio and the Mirage. The hotel has 3,960 rooms in six towers: Augustus, Nobu, Roman, Palace, Octavius and Forum (I was in the Forum tower).  It's a HUGE space and I initially found myself overwhelmed when I arrived.  But once I got my bearings and figured out where everything was I was okay.\n\nI liked my room.  The view from my room was fabulous!  My bed was so comfy!  There were buttons next to the bed opened and closed the blinds and sheers!  When the blinds were closed, I had no idea what time it was it was that dark.  Rather than hanging a \"Do not disturb\" sign on the doorknob, you indicate on a panel which is just inside the room if you want your room made up or not.  Just on the other side of the door outside in the corridor, the light is either red (do no disturb) or green (make up the room) or nothing.  I've never seen this before.\n\nThe toilet was in its own room within the bathroom.  There was a phone in the toilet room.  It took me a day to figure out that on the bathroom wall was a remote control for the TV in the bathroom mirror!  There was no tub but a huge shower.\n\nA few times I took a stroll through the Forum Shops, which is a shopping mall connected to Caesars Palace. It has been consistently ranked as one of the most successful shopping malls in the world and is the highest grossing mall in America, with higher sales per square foot than Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.  It includes more than 270 mid-range and luxury retailers, gourmet restaurants and bars.  The ceilings are painted like the sky\n\nI'm not a gambler and there were machines and tables EVERYWHERE!

I've never stayed at a Harrahs resort before usually I stay at M life and I will prob stay at a Harrahs resort from here on out.... At least gamble.\n\n1. Bacchanal Buffet : I've tried majority of the Vegas buffets (Aria,Bellagio,Mandalay,Wynn,etc..) but Cesar's easily took the cake. The dinner buffet was outstanding. The variety and quality of food made it worth the weight gain. From Prime Rib, Briskett to the Deserts I would highly recommend this buffet regardless of price.\n\n\n2. Pool: I stayed at Aria a few months back and was so disappointed in their pool that I went elsewhere when I wanted to relax in the sun and swim. Cesar's Palace pool area made me feel like I was living luxurious. Beautiful pools with great vibe to make you feel you are really living in a palace. There are waterfalls with blackjack in the pool. The best pool so far I've been to in Vegas..... I wouldn't really say this is a party type pool but highly recommend you become royal here.\n\n3. Gambling: For anyone who is I to gambling you'll understand me on this. People gamble for the enjoyment and fun of the game while making money and if you lose it it's okay cause you had a great time, you pay for entertainment. I've always stayed with M life resorts (MGM,Mandalay bay, Aria,etc....) and have gambled a lot in the past, majority of my trips but the rating system and comps for mlife has become so horrid and cheap that they just don't want to give anything in return. They told me at aria you had to average $130 per betting hand to really get good comps or let alone comps at all. I used to get comped buffets,hotel rooms, promotional chips all the time and that's what brought me out but they have declined so much and never comp anything that I've decided not to gamble at their resorts anymore. I stayed true to my word and haven't...... People should realize this as well.\n\nOne day into playing at Harrahs resorts (Cesar's palace,Paris and Planet Hollywood) they comped me a room and sent me offers as where I never receive anything anymore from mlife other than a 30% off your room..... Cesar's has a handful variety of games with very good and friendly dealers. The floor get to know your name and your story making you feel part of the them.\n\nThe hotel is beautiful, the room are very spacious with a big hot tub and glass shower, the food is phenomenal and even though it's pricey we don't go on vacation to be cheap, esp in Vegas.\n\nThank you Cesar's and Harrahs for an amazing experience.\n\nA+++"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "2", "name": "John", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-11-3", "review": "I have stayed at Caesars in the past and usually in an upgraded room.

If you gamble with the luck of the draw, you might get a nice room, or you might get a terrible room.  Per my opening statement, they're constantly renovating and improving them, but they have almost 4,000 rooms in the property.  It's a lot to renovate, and they have been open for almost 50 years, so it takes a long time.    \n\n(2) Their casino ventilation is not good.  People smoke in every casino, but the smoke lingers in Caesar's more than other places\n\n(3) Their pricing can be insane.  It's not uncommon for their rooms to be significantly more expensive than the Wynn or the Bellagio.  For all their efforts, Caesar's Palace isn't on the same level as the upper tier, so seeing that people are paying upwards of 2x to stay there always confuses me.  \n\n(4) Older clientele.

The glasses in the bathroom were not cleaned we'll (big white spots in both of them) and there was a lot of dust on the ledges and base boards.  Additionally, we had a constantly running toilet in the room.  If I called, We probably could have changed rooms or had it fixed but we arrived later than expected and had to leave quickly to make a scheduled event and it just wasn't worth the hassle at the time.  The room was starting to show its age as well (peeling wallpaper, part of the baseboard falling down in the bathroom, dents in the wall where suitcase and luggage racks had banged, hair dryer didn't work and kept making the breaker  pop and the lights go off) nothing we couldn't live with but also something I didn't expect from a 4.5 star hotel.  I know Vegas is specifically designed  to get you into the casinos and keep you there as long as possible but the lack of amenities in the room was worse than I've ever seen in 7 other  hotels on the strip (no fridge, mini bar, or coffee maker).   \n\nThe food in the hotel was very good but also very expensive and the casual options left much to be desired.  Another mind boggler was that you couldn't get a table at 1040 pm in anything other than the lobby restaurant because they closed at 11.  We were there running a race that ended at night directly in front of the hotel and had 40,000 people participating.

Thought everything was set-up and double-checked to avoid any complications (I booked through Travelzoo) and at 9 p.m. at night, I get a call from our family standing there unable to check in to their room after a day of flying to get there.   Working with Josh at the front desk, and John (the manager) was not as customer-friendly as I had hoped.    When I explained how I booked the room through a promo with Travelzoo, Josh asked me who Travelzoo was....  oh boy, I knew we were in for a long phone call.   It was one of the most stressful experiences I have had in a very long time - for something as stupid as booking a hotel room of all things (really people??), as I was home in California and not there in person with our guests to rectify the situation.  After calls to Travelzoo, Caesars concierge (Meredith is a shining star there!), and holding on two phones with the hotel check-in staff, 30+ minutes later, the problem was resolved.  We even wanted to bypass Travelzoo and pay with our credit card to get our family checked-in, and they needed an authorization faxed back to them...   no fax at home, we were in bed when we get this call and it was an unbelievably bad experience.    But it had to escalate to being uncomfortable and unpleasant - and that as awful.   I don't think I would recommend Travelzoo or Caesars for a Las Vegas trip to anyone.   It should not be this troublesome to have planned and paid for a room since October and then be treated like this.  I even called the hotel a few days in advance to make sure there would be no hiccups - thought they had it all figured out, but no.

We fully paid for a package and when we checked in the guy at the front desk suggested to upgrade to a better room. We asked for the price and he said he cannot tell us because we booked through a third party. It was obviously a lie so I said that we have to get the numbers before deciding. A magic happened and in 3 seconds he had the numbers, which were additional $800 (!!!) for our 6 nights stay, for a room that doesn't sound better.\nThen, we went up to the room and were surprised to see that:\n- the carpet was dirty (dried cranberries), and very OLD,\n- the faucets were full of corrosion,\n- one faucet was not working,\n- you have to flush the toilet twice because the first time does nothing,\n- very low light in the bathroom,\n- overall, the entire room was very old, felt like going back in time to the 90's.\nWe called front desk and they sent someone to fix the broken faucet, but that's about it. So we asked for a room transfer, and we asked to see the room first, they took us to see a room that was SMALLER (!!!) than our room, which was a waste of over 1 hour of wait time. We specifically paid for the slightly larger room because we were 4 in the room (3 adults). Then, they showed us a room which was the same size but had roughly the same issues as in our rooms, probably because the room was in the same tower (palace). We had to go all the way to the reception to get the key to the other room because they didn't want to send someone to give us the key (!!!). Even worse, initially they said we cannot see the room, we have to move without seeing it. Obviously I insisted on seeing it first.\nThen, we realized we will be billed for resort fee, which is common on the strip (as they said), even though our package said we fully paid for everything. We thought we don't have wifi so when they said the resort fee includes wifi we were at least happy about that. BUT, we only had one bar when we used the wifi!!! just in case it's not clear -- wifi with 1 bar feels like dial up, which completed our experience of a hotel in the 90's :(\nSo, we asked to talk to a manager after they suggested to take down the resort fee for a couple of days, which is a joke. The manager called us only at the next day at 10pm! and only to the room, even though we asked them to call our cell. And then we gave them our cell phone number again and they did the same thing after 2 more nights! so we only got to talk to a manger just before our last night there, after spending hours on the phone with probably almost 10 different representatives, explaining our issues over and over again.\nEventually the 2nd manager removed the resort fee completely, but it was not enough, I will never go back there.\nJust to be clear, if we had paid $60 a night as in the Excalibur then we would accept the poor maintenance of the room and also the service, but we paid much more for Caesars (hard to say exactly because it was a package with the flights) and we did not expect to feel like we're in the 90's.\nOther than the room, the casino stinks from smoking, slightly more than the average on the strip, and extremely more than new hotels such as Aria and Cosmopolitan.\nThe only reason we gave Caesars 'poor' instead of 'terrible' is the location, and also some restaurants were ok."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "4", "name": "Salman", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-12-26", "review": "We stayed at the Augustus tower in Caesar's Palace.

This was our first time to Vegas and we were excited! As soon as we exited our shuttle, the bell person offered to hold our bags if we couldn't check in immediately. As we walked in to check in, it was a little confusing because we weren't sure where to go. Everyone at the desk had 'Check Out' above them (we were there before 8 am). But we stood in line and we were able to check in early (Score!!). In regards to the incidental deposit we were able to void charging privileges and have our deposit at $200 for the stay instead of the $130/day deposit. Check in took between 5-10 minutes and we were on our way. \n\nThere is someone checking for room keys before you can get to the elevators. And every 7 floor, I believe, had a separate bank of elevators (6 elevators), so wait time was very minimal. The hallways are pretty long and we were towards the end of hallway but nothing unmanageable. \n\nThe room was beautiful and the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. The room for the most part was clean, however we did find a Starbucks stirrer on the floor. And twice throughout our stay, the maid did not replace our used toiletries, which is the reason for docking one star.

This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.\n\nThe experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.\n\nSuites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' \"cube\" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.\n\nMaster bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.\n\nNo worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.\n\nFriendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. \n\nSuites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded \"resort fee\" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.\n\nOh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.

From remote control curtains and touch screen remote control next to the bed, you definitely appreciate the modern touches. The view was also great with over-sized ceiling to floor windows overlooking part of The Strip. If you wanted to do Vegas and never leave your hotel, Aria has almost everything you need -- but then again so do most other Vegas hotels. The Spa was cool, if a bit overpriced. Same for the Brunch Buffet ($100+ for 2 people). The service was acceptable for Vegas, but definitely not the 5-star you would expect from a place charging premium prices. At times they were very accommodating - quick room service and surprisingly good food. But other times, I felt like I was in a Holiday Inn - they couldn't bring scissors up to my room to open a package I bought at their gift shop. The lady at the front desk was friendly and sent up a little \"treat\" when we mentioned that we were in town as part of our honeymoon.\n\nOverall I expected more for the price but you can't go wrong if you want a solid experience and are willing to pay a little more for it."}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "1", "name": "Kara", "probability": "0", "date": "2014-10-9", "review": "Wow.

We booked a non-smoking City-view King room, and warned them that we'd be checking in very late (our plane arrived at midnight).  After an exhausting trip, we got to the check in desk to find that we were the only one in line and the four agents were helping other customers.  But as soon as one customer finished up, the agent closed her station instead of helping us.  Not a good first impression.  That was when we were told that our room was a \"smoking optional\" room and that our \"non-smoking\" reservation was \"just a request.\"  Well, that wasn't how it was presented to us when we booked.\n\nWe got to the room, which we were assured would not smell, and it reeked.  My husband was up coughing all night.  I had problems of my own.  The beds at Aria are ridiculously soft.  You literally sink into the mattress and there is no support.  All night I tossed and turned between nightmares of being stuck on high-gravity planets, being swallowed by pit monsters, being paralyzed, and sinking into quicksand.  And the \"blackout\" curtains leak a lot of light from the top and bottom, so in the morning when the sun rose at 7AM, I had no choice but to wake up with it, in spite of having fallen asleep at 2:30.\n\nTo be fair, the rooms themselves are gorgeous.  The decor is sumptuous but modern and tasteful and every room juts out a bit to give you a bit of a corner view.  The curtains and sheers open and close with the touch of a button and all the lights are on wall controls.  A single touch of a button by your bedside turns of all the lights and closes the curtains for you.\n\nThe lobby and public spaces are really cool with an eclectic modern decor worthy of the newest cruise ships.  There's always some new detail to discover.  The buffet is extensive and we didn't have wait in lines, but the food wasn't any better than a buffet in, say, Reno.\n\nThe second night they moved us to a larger room on a higher floor that was nonsmoking.  That was much better, but I still had a lot of trouble with the mattress.  I woke up at 3:30 AM with a horrible pain in my back (I do have some back issues, but I usually don't have trouble with hotel mattresses).  I finally put the two lounge chairs in the room together and slept on those, which was an improvement, but still not comfortable.  I don't know why Aria has chosen to go to such an extreme with their mattress selection.  It's like sleeping on a sack of peanut butter.  \n\nThat morning, I told my husband that we had a choice: we could either risk moving to a new hotel and eat the third night we'd booked at the Aria or I was buying a ticket home for that afternoon.  We checked out and went to the Mandarin Oriental.\n\nI won't comment on the bars or casinos because I scarcely drink and we don't gamble.

I still recommend watching your credit card statements because they were definitely a surprise.\n\nThe hotel itself is pretty nice.  It's a newer hotel compared to the Bellagio and you can see that during the stay.  The bed is as comfortable as others have noticed and the rooms were clean.\n\nThe food selection at the Aria is fantastic.  I am one of those folks who hates dressing up but still likes having nice dinners.  Most restaurants at the Aria allow casual dress but still have excellent quality.  \n\nHappy Hours are plenty.  A number of the restaurants on site have happy hours with discounted food and drink.\n\nAwesome spa.  I bought a pass to use the spa facilities (around $30-$35) I believe.  The spa facilities include use of a private pool, multiple Jacuzzi's (Cold, Warm, and Hot), sauna and eucalyptus steam room, salt room, and Japanese Stone beds.  All of them were awesome.  The amenities are also some of the best I have seen out there.\n\nThere were some things that kept me from giving them the full 5 stars.  Most of the reasons are based on my past experiences at the Bellagio.  Both are MGM properties and both are AAA 5 diamond award winners.  Here are some things that the Aria does not do:\n\n1. Turn down service is not done for standard rooms\n2. Location.  It is a little more of a challenge to get anywhere outside of City Center from the Aria.  Even with the train, it's still a pain to get anywhere\n3. Level of service was kind of dry.  Not sure what it was but I didn't feel as though the staff was willing to do what it takes to make a customer happy.\n\nI'm glad I had a chance to try the Aria out.

They live up to their five diamond designation and sophisticated design.   \n\nOur room was spectacular.   We did not have a strip view, but a gorgeous view of the mountains and the Monte Carlo.   The room was impeccably appointed with modern, luxurious decor.   The technology was really fun.   As others have noted, the curtains opened to greet us when we entered the room.   The control panel allowed us to control the electronics for the entire room without ever leaving our bed!\n\nWe had 2 queen beds as requested, and they were very comfortable.   Each bed came with a practical tower of incredibly soft, comfortable pillows.   The bathroom was beautifully laid out in what appeared to be some kind of marble.   \n\nI cannot sing the praises enough of the Concierge desk.   All of our interactions with them were fun, helpful, and quickly responded to.   They always worked hard to help get our reservations, questions, or concerns addressed with a  smile.  We had great experiences in the casino, the lobby bar, Julian Serrano, Sage, and Cirque du Soleil as well.\n\nAs others have noted, the Aria is pricey.  Cocktails at the pool will run you a minimum of $20 per mixed drink in general, but that's Vegas!   Vegas is not a budget vacation destination and the Aria lives into making it feel like a luxury experience.\n\nA couple of customer service notes:\n\n1.  We checked in with a large group at the end of Columbus Day weekend.   We waited in line for check-in nearly 30 minutes and they seemed a little bit unprepared for the rush.   A group check-in desk for large parties would be REALLY helpful.\n\n2.  When we arrived, a room was not ready for us until after 4 PM Vegas time despite the fact check-in is 3 PM.   It took two visits and a $10 tip for the concierge to get us into a room.   We had left the East Coast at 5 AM that morning and were utterly exhausted.  \n\n3.  The toilet in our room didn't work upon our arrival and it took about 24 hours to get it repaired.

Aria looks breathtaking structurally from the outside as you drive in from the strip and into the City Center. The little fountains of dancing water and the lights showcasing them, as well as the buildings of the resort also. Very modern and right in line with all the new hotels in Vegas.\n\nBut the one thing I noticed when I first walked in here the first few months they were open and on recent trips since is that it's dark in this hotel. I mean, I felt like my eyes were deceiving me but the dim lighting on the casino floor and surrounding areas did not leave a good impression on me. I'll never forget it cause I was thinking that and remarked to my friends in amazement how a brand new (at the time) hotel & casino that was the epicenter of the City Center (also brand new at the time) could be so poorly lit?!? Not good... And also there are a lot of \"dead\" zones and corners that are just wasted space within the casino floor and the 24 hour restaurant/cafe towards the back of the property. \n\nAnd I cant go without reviewing the valet. Valet lane is a bit confusing and hard to spot at first with their signs being so small. By the time you realize you've mistakenly taken the thru-traffic or taxi lane, it's too late and you gotta go all the way around to finally valet your car. Valet pickup is a decent setup with a nice air-conditioned room for you to wait in with magazines & vending machines. Not sure how long they expect you to wait for your car but that was an interesting touch. I thought the placement of the valet being all the way towards the front end of the Aria property was too long of a walk. You actually leave the casino through 2 sets of double doors before you reach the valet station to drop off your ticket. I might be hypercritical but ease & convenience of valet dictates where I like to stay in Vegas sometimes...

Many people don't seem to understand that staying on the strip is expensive so you gotta take what you can get.  The Miracle Mile is just across the street for shopping and some cheap eats.

Our room was very spacious with a living room, dining room, two bathrooms (one of them being super massive with three sinks and a bath tub in the center) and a bedroom.

More specifically, our room was within the Aria Sky Suites section of the hotel.  When I was told that the Sky Suites was a Forbes Five Star and AAA Five Diamond award winner, I must be honest and say I didn't understand the significance of those distinctions.  However, after only a two night stay I can truly see why those awards have been bestowed upon them.  Being a guest at the Sky Suites was truly an experience unrivaled and unmatched by any other hotel I've stayed at.\n\nAs a guest of Aria Sky Suites, your \"experience\" actually begins upon your arrival at the airport, where the driver of your limo will meet you at your baggage claim.  This service is complimentary and the hotel is accessed via a private entrance/driveway onto the property.  Check-in is also private and is near a lounge area for sky suite guests.\n\nWalking to our room, the hallway had a very contemporary 70's-esque look to it.  In any case it was quite unique.  Upon arriving at your room, just lightly tap the key card against the door sensor to center.\n\nAmenities of our suite included:\n\n*Bar are with mini-fridge, sink, wine bucket, glasses, wine opener, and beer opener as well.\n\n*Powder room just off the entrance to the suite.\n\n*Spacious living room area with sofa, chairs, coffee table, wide desk, flat screen television and decent-sized table seating four.\n\n*Immense and spacious bathroom with closet space, stand up shower, dual vanities and a sizable bathtub positioned in the center.  There's also a dental kit provided with dental floss, toothpaste, and shaving necessities.  \n\n*Master bedroom is just as spacious as the bathroom.  In fact, it may nearly be the same size.  The bed is extremely comfortable and the pillows exceptionally soft.  There's also a flat screen tv and a small bench/sitting area at the foot of the bed.\n\n*Push button controls for the blinds/shades for the entire room.  There's also a tablet near the bed that houses the \"master controls\" for the entire suite.  \n\n*Turn down service in the evening.  Staff will turn down the bed and provide slippers for guests.  We later discovered all the extra pillows on the bed were placed in the bathroom closet on the top shelf.\n\nOther amenities during our stay at Sky Suites included:\n\n*Guest lounge in the lobby is stocked with pastries and fruits in the morning as well as coffee and tea.  Guests are also able to retrieve/help themselves to waters and sodas from their mini-fridges.\n\n*The aforementioned complimentary limo service/transportation to and from the airport.\n\nThe Aria property has many features/amenities to keep guests entertained and busy during their stay.  Of course there are the requisite casino, bars, night club and lounges.  In addition, restaurants/eateries and shopping opportunities abound as there are various restaurants within the hotel or next door at the Crystals shopping mall.  There is also a tram that connects the Aria with the Crystals Mall and Bellagio Hotel.\n\nOverall, I think I have nothing to complain about.  Well, except the housekeeping staff ringing the doorbell while I was trying to nap.  However, I must excuse them since they were just stopping by to ask if we needed anything, which I thought was very kind.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and comfortable stay at Aria Sky Suites."}, {"type": "Positive Deceptive", "stars": "5", "name": "Jaleebi", "probability": "1", "date": "2014-11-9", "review": "My staff and I just checked out after a great weekend at the Aria.

Every light in your room shuts off, it's now pitch black, and you're trying to figure out how to undo that.

Maybe not \"snob\", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.\n\nActually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nThe non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.\n\nHowever, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was \"meh\" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.\n\nI ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.\n\nThe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.\n\nTo be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff.

This change is because of the service they provided during my stay this time around. \nThere were 3 major incidents that made me HATE ARIA. \n\nI had PRIVATE sign on in my room because I wanted to sleep in. Around 12PM, someone knocks on my door and asks me if I need towels which is bizarre. Why would you ever knock on a room that has a private sign on it in first place and I didn't even ask for towels. Now, if the incident stopped here, I wouldn't mind too much, but this person opens the door using his key which shocked me so much. I was just resting in my bed, but what if I was taking a shower, or doing something else in the room that required privacy? Or perhaps even just changing my clothes? As soon as I heard the door open I quickly told the person that I do not need towels and told him to leave. \n\nI left the room the second day with a housekeeping sign on, since I didn't receive housekeeping in the morning. I came back to the room after lunch and looking around some places, but there was no housekeeping done. I was fine with this, because we were outside only for about 2-3 hours. So I simply gave housekeeping a call, and let them know that we will be leaving the room again in about 5 minutes. I told the person that I would be coming back pretty soon and asked for the room to be cleaned meantime. I actually went out that time so that the room could be cleaned, I didn't really want to go out. Anyhow, I came back 2 hours later to find my room in the exact same condition as how it was before I left. I called housekeeping again and told them what happened and they said they will send someone immediately. It was such an inconvenience because I had to leave the room at 2AM so that they can clean it. I was hovering on Aria lobby for over an hour waiting for the room to be cleaned. Terrible experience. \n\nAfter this, I was pretty frustrated and I called the front desk about what happened, especially regarding the person coming into my room. The front desk apologized and told me that they will make sure this never happens again. \n\nLastly, on the third night, again I had the private sign on. Someone again knocks on my door. I was thinking, well this time they won't come in since I called the front desk yesterday. NO. THIS PERSON OPENS MY DOOR AND COMES IN AGAIN. I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. I called the front desk pretty furious this time. They apologized of course and took the resort fee off and everything. \n\nSTILL I think this is pretty unacceptable.

There are good lounges within the casino area, but the main nightclub is currently closed for renovation.  \n\nCheck out the 2nd floor for a great, not too crowded Starbucks and good clothing shopping.\n\nI would definitely stay here again!"}, {"type": "Truthful", "stars": "3", "name": "Vickie", "probability": "NA", "date": "2014-12-26", "review": "I wanted to give Aria 5 stars but a couple of things happened throughout my stay that reduced its rating in my book. \n\nFirst the Pro - \n\n1. A high end hotel with high tech rooms. All the lighting, curtains, TVs, music, can be controlled through a tablet device next to the bed. \n\n2. Stellar customer service all the way from bell desk, to house keeping, to concierge, and to the valet. \n\n3. The hotel is not nearly as crowded as Bellagio and Caesar's palace. On Christmas day, those two hotels were like an over crowded farmers market, while Aria maintained a steady, and nice number of players and guests on the casino floor. \n\n4. The gym was very nice. \n\n5. Got a $75 meal credit to each room we booked. This deal effectively paid for the resort fee charged. I thought that was a nice touch. \n\n\nNow the Con - \n\n1. The drinks served at the poker tables were extremely watered down. I might was well paid for a real drink as I was sure that I was drinking sugar water. \n\n2. The concierge girl gave me tons of wrong information including business hours of the nearby outlet, and location of the nearest Burberry store, which resulted in me walking an extra 15 minutes just to get to the correct location. \n\n3. Made a dinner reservation at Lemongrass through the hotel reservation line. The restaurant later said they never got the reservation. \n\n4. Luggage service had a 45 minutes wait time at check out because they were receiving all calls at one time. I understand it was busy... but I think the hotel could have anticipated this and hire extra shifts for holiday seasons. The lady I spoke to at the bell desk was not patient (an exception to rest of the great service I received throughout my stay).  \n\n\nI want to increase my rating but for now Aria stays at 3 stars.

The room was huge but the space was all wasted-- there was no refrigerator so we threw tons of leftover food away during our stay (not what you want in a city known for food), the television was positioned so that you couldn't watch it from the bed without straining, the decor was hideous and my back hurt every morning when I woke up from the terribly uncomfortable beds.

When I booked the hotel, it averaged around $80-$115 a night.  Very reasonable for a strip hotel.\n\nYet...this hotel comes with crappy old movie memorabilia inside your hotel room.  We had some obscure 1995 Cindy Crawford movie poster hanging in the bathroom, an entire costume/outfit from the movie glued to the freaking wall (taking up an entire wall space where a window could have gone), and a Cindy Crawford book permanently implanted inside a table.  Not the most classy hotel room decor.  The windows (or should I say window, as in ONE) were too small, which was unfortunate because it had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain.  You also could hear the water running very loudly in the adjacent hotel rooms.  It actually sounded like Niagara Falls was in the next room over.  They need to work on sound-proofing the rooms because we could hear youngins clubbing it up down below.  Not pleasant when you're too old for that shit and you want a good night's sleep.\n\nThere was only one sink, but a separate shower and tub, which is always nice.  Two sinks would have been nicer though, because sharing sinks with the hubby isn't fun.  They do have 24 hour room service, which actually had great pizza that was very similar to Round Table.

I don't know how any of you can say anything negative about the Mirage. Did we not stay at the same hotel?\n\nI will start with their taxi stand. I think that they have a very organized system. Jason (I think thats his name) is AWESOME! My husband and I stayed there in April and he remembered us every single time. My husband and I also stayed at the Mirage in September AND HE STILL REMEMBERED US!! I was so blown away! AMAZING!\n\nThe check in line does look pretty long. Especially because check in is usually at 3pm unless you request/pay for early check in. Don't be fooled though. The line moves pretty quickly. However the check in/concierge staff is very efficient. \n\nThe rooms are nice. I mean if you ARE paying for a standard room, don't expect a huge amount of space with a gorgeous view. You do get what you pay for. I would also like to note I love their elevator system. They have about six or so different areas to take you to your room. So like the first area is for floor 1-5 the second area is like 6-10 etc. There are also about six elevators in each area. I really love this system because you are never waiting for an elevator. The elevator is never full. & each elevator only goes up a certain amount of floors. We've all had those horrible experiences where we are at the 24th floor, but other people in your elevator are on floor 8, 12, 19, and 21. HOW ANNOYING. That problem NEVER happens at the Mirage!\n\nThe housekeeping staff is very friendly. You are always greeted while walking down the hall!\n\nI also love the Mirage casino. I think that the casino here ISNT as smokey as some other casinos. I think the high ceilings near the waterfall help. Also, the casino is very easy to navigate around, unlike Caesars. Eeek. \n\nI think there are good dining options here, different varieties. However, no cheap food court like options, except for Starbucks.

As I look into hotels for an upcoming Vegas trip this winter, I considered the Mirage, then remembered our last stay with them was all too stressful and that I would have to run out of other hotel options before staying with them again. And even then, I would probably prefer to pitch a tent on a sky bridge. \n\nMy friend, Robinson, had booked the room for a college bud reunion, and he specifically chose the Mirage because he enjoyed his previous stays. Despite better prices on comparable hotels, he chose the Mirage because he wanted to give this resort his business. The Mirage had won him over, then lost him very, very quickly. \n\nOur first night there, we check in and the man at the front desk is lovely. We head up to room, start getting ready for evening plans (the outfit changing, the hair curling, the sipping of champagne, you know the drill) and not even 30 minutes after settling in, we get a knock on the door from security. We were being warned that we needed to \"quiet down.\"\n\nIt was about 8 pm. No later than 8:30. And here is the part where you may not believe me, but I insist, we were NOT being loud. We had music lightly playing and we were chatting as friends do when they haven't interacted in person for months. No girlish screams, no chanting of \"shots!\"... I wish I had that energy. We are all in our mid-late twenties. Our black-out-drunk/fake ID days are over. \n\nSo, we apologize and we oblige then continue to get ready. 15 minutes later, another knock. This time, security is rude. \"One more noise complaint and you guys will be kicked out.\" Excuse me? It's barely dark out thanks to that summer sun, and you're telling me that Sia crooning softly in the background is upsetting the geriatrics that are next door? \n\nFine. Edna and Ralph can't find a way to turn down their hearing aids. So we call the front desk and request a room change. As bitter as I sound now, we really didn't want to ruin anyone else's vacation, so we would have happily switched rooms to save theirs and our own. Our request was denied and we were welcomed to the Mirage with an explanation of the three strike policy. One more call to security, and these neighbors of ours had the power to have us escorted from our room and off of the premises. \n\nWe spent the rest of the night rushing around in silence, trying to ready ourselves as quickly as possible so we could escape the silent prison that was our hotel room. \n\nDiscussing this series of events with management was pointless. We were treated like children. Post-collegiate, money-spending, rule-abiding CHILDREN. \n\nYou guys did give us $25 worth of free drinks at any Mirage bar, but because of the way we were treated, I'm only assuming it was to get us drunk enough to actually kick us out. Jokes on you, $25 is only enough for two cocktails made with one cocktail's worth of liquor.

This made it incredibly difficult to find the egregious errors that they had made when I sent over my final staff list.

I dropped my elderly passengers off at the front entrance of the hotel/casino among a throng of cabs, shuttles, and limousines.  Getting back out to the street and re-entering to go to self-parking went smoothly in spite of the exceptional level of both automotive and pedestrian traffic on Black Friday.  I found the self-parking facility convenient and easy to navigate.  The walk back to the main lobby from there is surprisingly short, including an elevator ride, an open-air bridge, and an escalator ride.  Self-parking is free of charge.\n\nThe casino facility is typical, with everything from \"penny\" slots to dedicated high-stakes areas.  Beverages at the lobby bar are pricey but normal for any major venue on the Strip.\n\nThe show is a huge engineering production incorporating multimedia, a highly dynamic stage, and of course Cirque de Soleil's incomparable displays of acrobatics, dance, and special effects.  There are no animals and no clowns, just some of the finest human talent you will see anywhere with fantastic costumes and innovative props.  The interpretive show provides a powerful review of the enduring influence the music and art of The Beatles has had on our music and our culture.  I found it very moving, and was surprised at the level of familiarity with the music shown by my mom and her siblings (I' m 56, she's 80.)\n\nI walked out of the Mirage with a big grin on my face and some of my favorite songs playing in my head.

We arrived on Sunday 12/14 only to find their parking lot full to the top due to two big events at the hotel, a cheerleading championship and a rodeo event. It took us 45 minutes to find a spot and it was on the roof ( 8th floor ). At the front desk, we were warned about the mini snack bar in the room, They told us that it had sensors and that any thing we remove will be charged to the room even if not consumed. We had kids with us and were constantly making sure they did not remove any candy bars or other items from the snack bar so we wouldn't be charged the outrageous prices for the items inside ( $3.50 for M&M, $5 for five hour energy etc.,,). Our room had no fridge but we were told that they could arrange for a mini fridge for $25/day. Really? we stayed in December but what would anyone do in Vegas in August without a mini fridge inside the room? The lady at the check-in desk also failed to mention anything about our $50 food and beverage credit which was supposed to be part of the booking package from the Mirage website itself. We had to remind her and she seemed rather disappointed that we mentioned the credit. \nWe called housekeeping and requested extra bath towels for the kids but our request was ignored and we had to call again the next day to get the towels.\nThe bath tub was slow draining and needed about 5 minutes after the shower is done to drain all the water..!!!\nThe cocktail servers at the casino were extremely slow and generally a no show on the casino floor.\nHere is the worst part: The hotel emailed us a bill on check out day with a full charge from the buffet not factoring the $50 food and beverage credit. We had to call the front desk and remind them with the credit and that's when they re-sent an email with the correct bill.\nFinally, WI-FI was terrible. Comes and goes momentarily. We called the front desk and were transferred to the tech person who insisted their WI-FI was not at fault.\nSo here we go: A hotel that will nickel and dime you by having a snack bar to sell you overpriced crap, instead of a mini fridge to make your stay more pleasant. Oh wait, you can get mini fridge for extra on top of the resort fee that you pay for the crappy internet and the crappier housekeeping...\nOn top of it, bad billing and accounting practices and thin room doors and walls...\nNo thanks.

As soon as I opened the hotel door, I was impressed because it was nicer than I had expected until I stepped into the bathroom to wash up before going out and spotted hair in the bathtub. SO GROSS! I know for certain it was not mine or my friend's because we both have longer hair than the hair found in the bathtub. I immediately called housekeeping and they said that they would send someone up immediately to clean the bathtub. One hour and 5 more phone calls later, I was fed up. Every time I called, they replied back with \"Someone will there in ten minutes\". Are they playing games with me??! \nI called the front desk and requested to speak with the manager. She empathized with me and told me that she will get back to me soon. Turns out that housekeeping also said ten more minutes and she told me to wait until 11:17pm and the minute housekeeping was late, to contact her back. I gave one star for the manager, \nThey literally came the second it turned 11:17. A lady came in smiling and it seemed like she cleaned the bathtub as the hairs were gone, but the second the shower turned on, the hairs appeared. It seems like the housekeeping lady just moved the hairs into the cracks and made it just look like it was gone? -_- Are you kidding me? At this point, I just cleaned the hairs myself because I was running so late. I never want to stay here again. If their housekeeping works like this, I cant imagine how dirty the entire room would be. Maybe they just sweep everything into the cracks and hide all the trash and dirt.
